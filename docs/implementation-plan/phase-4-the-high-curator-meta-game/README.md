# Phase 4: The "High Curator" (Meta-Game)

### 1. The Global Museum: Competitive Curation

The Museum is the ultimate "Prestige" system. It is a shared, global UI where players compete to prove they have the most culturally significant collection.

* Weekly Themes: The Museum curators (NPCs) announce a weekly theme (e.g., _"The Age of Plastic"_ or _"Portable Entertainment"_).
* The Exhibition: Players "assign" their best items to the exhibition. Assigning an item locks it from the Bazaar for the duration of the week.
* The Score: Every item in the Museum earns a Historical Value (HV) score based on:
  * Rarity & Condition: (Mythic Mint = Peak Score).
  * Mint Number: (Low-mints provide a massive multiplier).
  * Set Completion: Bonus points if you provide the entire set of themed items.
* The Leaderboard: A real-time ranking of the top "Curators" in the world.

### 2. Historical Influence: The Third Currency

This phase introduces Historical Influence (HI), a non-tradable currency earned exclusively through Museum participation and World Events.

* Purpose: HI is used to buy "The Unbuyables."
* Influence Shop:
  * Zone Permits: Unlocks high-level dig sites (e.g., _The Sunken Data Center_).
  * Elite Skill Training: Unlocks the ability to push skills from level 90 to 99.
  * Custom Titles: Tag your username in the Global Feed (e.g., _Archeologist \[PlayerName] found..._).
  * Vault Expansions: Massive storage upgrades only available to "Proven Curators."

### 3. World Events: "The Great Thaw"

To keep the UI dynamic, World Events trigger global changes that affect every player's "Dig" and "Sift" screens for a limited time (48–72 hours).

* The Event Logic: A massive notification appears in the Global Feed: _"SENSORS DETECT: A collapse in the Old Suburbs has revealed the \[Department Store] layer!"_
* Temporary Tiers:
  * Event-Only Loot: New items that _only_ drop during the 48-hour window.
  * Stat Shifts: e.g., "Radioactive Dust Storm" (Extraction speed +50%, but Sift Success -10%).
* Global Progress Bars: A shared bar at the top of the UI. _"Players must collectively mine 10,000,000 Scrap to clear the rubble."_ Once cleared, everyone who participated gets a reward.

### 4. Advanced Skilling: Appraisal & Smelting

With the influx of high-value items, the specialized RPG skills become critical for the economy.

#### 4.1 Appraisal (Level 60+)

* Hidden Attributes: High-level Appraisers can see "Sub-stats" on relics that others can't (e.g., _"Historical Value +12% based on previous owner's fame"_).
* Verification: Appraisers can "Verify" items for others (for a fee), adding a permanent "Certified" badge to the item’s UI, increasing its resale value.

#### 4.2 Smelting (Level 60+)

* Bulk Processing: The ability to "Auto-Smelt" junk by tier.
* Component Extraction: A small chance to recover "Cursed Fragments" from shattering high-level items, which can later be crafted into Stabilizer Charms.

### Phase 4 Success Metrics

1. Engagement: Over 40% of the active player base "donates" at least one item to the Weekly Museum.
2. HI Circulation: Players are actively saving Historical Influence to unlock the second and third "Dig Zones."
3. Event Spikes: A 2x increase in active "Digs" during the 48-hour World Event window.
4. Skill Depth: Players are reaching Level 99 in specialized skills and displaying their "Master's Badges" in the Museum.
