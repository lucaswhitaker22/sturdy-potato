# Flavor Text & World Building

## Flavor Text & World Building

Flavor text is the world.

In a UI-first game, item notes do the immersion work.

Every relic should ship with a short **Vault Research Note** written by the Archive.

### The voice (non-negotiable)

Write like a bureaucratic researcher.

They are confident and often wrong.

Keep it dry.

Avoid modern slang.

### Writing rules

* One to two sentences.
* One joke per note.
* Clinical tone, detached language.
* If you reference factions, default to “the Archive”.

### Canon categories of misinterpretation

Use these as reusable “mental buckets” for consistency:

* **Ritualistic Objects**
  * Everyday items reframed as cult tools.
* **Primitive Tech**
  * Electronics treated as inert mystery artifacts.
* **Social Signifiers**
  * Accessories treated as rank markers and status tools.

### Examples (keep these patterns consistent)

* **Paper Coffee Cup (Starbucks)**\
  “A sacrificial vessel from the ‘Siren Cult.’ Evidence suggests a global ritual involving brown liquids.”
* **USB Flash Drive (2GB)**\
  “A ‘Knowledge Crystal.’ The contents are corrupted, but the vessel remains a symbol of lost omniscience.”
* **Plastic Fidget Spinner**\
  “A sophisticated inertial dampening device. Ancient records claim scholars used it to focus during the Great Distraction.”
* **Remote Control**\
  “A long-range button-array used to communicate with the Glowing Boxes. Most buttons show signs of compulsive ritual pressing.”

### Where flavor text shows up (system integration)

Flavor isn’t just cosmetic.

It’s used as social proof and collection glue:

* **Vault**: item card “Research Note” block.
* **Bazaar**: short excerpt in listing details (optional).
* **Global Feed**: broadcast the note on rare finds (recommended).
* **Museum**: weekly themes can key off these categories.
