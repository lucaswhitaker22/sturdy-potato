# Progression Pillars

## Progression Pillars

Progression is four interlocking tracks.

Each track answers a different player question.

* **Power**: “How do I output more per minute?”
* **Mastery**: “How do I become better at risk?”
* **Collection**: “What long-term set am I building?”
* **Prestige**: “How do I prove it to the server?”

### The four pillars (canonical)

1. **Collection progression (sets and identity)**\n Set completion and set-locking.\n See: [Collection progression (sets and identity)](collection-progression-sets-and-identity.md)
2. **Power progression (Scrap → Workshop)**\n Tools, automation, and Scrap sinks.\n See: [Power progression (Scrap → Workshop)](power-progression-scrap-workshop.md)
3. **Mastery progression (skills 1–99)**\n Permanent skill grind and gates.\n See: [Mastery progression (skills 1–99)](mastery-progression-skills-1-99.md)
4. **Prestige progression (Museum + HI)**\n Weekly competition and untradeable rewards.\n See: [Prestige progression (Museum + HI)](prestige-progression-museum-+-hi.md)

### How they interlock (the intended “ladder”)

This is the cleanest mental model:

1. **Field** produces Scrap and Crates.\n Canon: [The Dig Site (Main Screen)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-dig-site-main-screen.md)
2. **Lab** converts Crates into items.\n Risk creates spikes.\n Canon: [The Refiner (The Gambling Hub)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-refiner-the-gambling-hub.md)
3. **Vault** makes keep/sell/smelt/lock decisions.\n Identity matters here.\n Canon: [3 - The Loot & Collection Schema](../../3-the-loot-and-collection-schema.md)
4. **Bazaar** converts items into Scrap.\n Scrap pushes Workshop.\n Canon: [The Bazaar (Auction House)](../../4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/the-bazaar-auction-house.md)
5. **Museum** converts locked items into HI.\n HI unlocks permits and status.\n Canon: [The Global Museum (Social Leaderboard)](../../4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/the-global-museum-social-leaderboard.md)

### Gates (what gets locked, and why)

Use the lightest gate that achieves pacing.

#### Gate types (ordered by “harshness”)

1. **Soft gates**\n “Recommended power” and visible warnings.\n Default choice.
2. **Workshop gates**\n Tool tier and upgrade requirements.\n These gate throughput.
3. **Skill gates**\n Single-skill requirements.\n These gate Lab viability and intel.
4. **Total Level gates**\n Multi-skill requirements.\n These gate zones.\n Canon: [5 - RPG Skilling System](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/)
5. **HI permit gates**\n Prestige access.\n These gate elite zones and identity unlocks.\n Canon: [Currency Systems](../../4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/currency-systems.md)

#### “Hard lock” states players must understand

Locks are not gates.

Locks are item-level states that block actions.

Canonical lock state rules live in:

* [3 - The Loot & Collection Schema](../../3-the-loot-and-collection-schema.md)
* [The Bazaar (Auction House)](../../4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/the-bazaar-auction-house.md)
* [The Global Museum (Social Leaderboard)](../../4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/the-global-museum-social-leaderboard.md)

### Milestones by phase (what “good progress” looks like)

#### Early game (first hour)

You should hit all five decks once.

Targets:

* Buy your first Workshop tier.\n Power pillar.
* Learn Claim vs Sift once.\n Mastery pillar.
* Start tracking one set.\n Collection pillar.
* See the Museum theme.\n Prestige pillar.

#### Mid game (week 1)

You should feel “machine momentum.”

Targets:

* Automation is your main Scrap engine.\n Power pillar.
* Skills reach `60`.\n Abilities + builds unlock.\n Mastery pillar.
* You complete at least one small set.\n Collection pillar.
* You submit to the Museum weekly.\n Prestige pillar.

#### Late game (month 1+)

You should have identity and a server footprint.

Targets:

* Overclocking becomes a real sink.\n Power pillar.\n Canon: [The Workshop (Progression)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-workshop-progression.md)
* Total Level gates fall.\n Mastery pillar.
* You chase low-mints and Prismatics.\n Collection pillar.\n Canon: [The "Mint & Condition" System](../../3-the-loot-and-collection-schema/the-mint-and-condition-system.md)
* HI is spent on permits and status.\n Prestige pillar.

### Non-negotiables (integrity rules)

These constraints keep every page aligned:

* The Field’s `5%` Anomaly outcome never changes.\n Canon: [The Dig Site (Main Screen)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-dig-site-main-screen.md)
* The Lab stage table is canonical.\n Canon: [The Refiner (The Gambling Hub)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-refiner-the-gambling-hub.md)
* Mint assignment is atomic and server-owned.\n Canon: [The "Mint & Condition" System](../../3-the-loot-and-collection-schema/the-mint-and-condition-system.md)
* HI cannot be purchased or traded.\n Canon: [Currency Systems](../../4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/currency-systems.md)

### Where this shows up in UI

Primary surfaces:

* **Workshop**: Power targets.\n [The Workshop (Progression)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-workshop-progression.md)
* **Vault**: Skill dashboard + set tracker.\n [6 - UI/UX Wireframe & Flow](../../6-ui-ux-wireframe-and-flow.md)
* **Archive**: Quests, achievements, Museum.\n [6 - Progression, Quests, Achievements](../)
