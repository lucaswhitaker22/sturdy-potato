# Mastery progression (skills 1–99)

## Mastery progression (skills 1–99)

Mastery progression is the permanent grind.

It creates “veteran advantage” without invalidating the loop.

Canon anchors:

* Full skill model: [5 - RPG Skilling System](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/)
* Field skill surface: [Excavation](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/excavation.md)
* Lab skill surface: [Restoration](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/restoration.md)
* Bazaar skill surface: [Appraisal](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/appraisal.md)
* Inventory cleanup surface: [Smelting](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/smelting.md)

### What skills do (at a glance)

Skills do three things:

* raise competence,\n like Lab Stability,
* unlock actions,\n like active abilities at `60+`,
* gate content,\n via skill and Total Level requirements.

### The four core skills (canonical)

* **Excavation**\n Field throughput and manual extraction feel.
* **Restoration**\n Lab stability and failure mitigation tools.
* **Appraisal**\n Market trust and information advantage.
* **Smelting**\n Scrap conversion efficiency and bulk processing.

### The “advanced layer” at level 60

Level `60` is the build breakpoint.

At `60+`, skills unlock:

* one active ability,\n and
* one specialization branch choice.

Canon references:

* Abilities: [Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)](../../../expansion-plan/skills-expansion/1.-active-skill-abilities-tactile-commands.md)
* Branches: [Skill Sub-Specializations (The Branching Path)](../../../expansion-plan/skills-expansion/2.-skill-sub-specializations-the-branching-path.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
Specializations should bias playstyle.\n They should not secretly buff drop odds.
{% endhint %}

### Level 99 mastery (prestige + small mechanical edge)

Level `99` is a global identity moment.

It should always trigger:

* a broadcast,
* a permanent badge,
* a clear “mastery perk” line.

### Total Level gates (pacing across zones)

Total Level is the sum of the four core skills.

It gates late zones and systems.

Canonical baseline gates:

* Sunken Mall: Total Level `100`
* Corporate Archive: Total Level `250`
* Sovereign Vault: Total Level `380`

### How mastery touches the main loop

Mastery must feel strong, but fair.

Examples of “fair mastery edges” already defined:

* Better manual extraction feel.\n Sweet spot readability.\n Canon: [The Dig Site (Main Screen)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-dig-site-main-screen.md)
* Higher visible Lab Stability.\n Canon: [The Refiner (The Gambling Hub)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-refiner-the-gambling-hub.md)
* Better intel, not better RNG.\n Canon: Appraisal references in [The Refiner (The Gambling Hub)](../../2-the-mechanics/the-refiner-the-gambling-hub.md)
* Better conversion efficiency.\n Canon: [Smelting](../../5-rpg-skilling-system/smelting.md)

### Late-game extensions (after 60)

These systems add depth without changing the four-skill foundation:

* Cross-skill masteries.\n Canon: [Cross-Skill Masteries (Synergy Unlocks)](../../../expansion-plan/skills-expansion/3.-cross-skill-masteries-synergy-unlocks.md)
* Skill-gated blueprints.\n Canon: [Skill-Gated "Ancient Blueprints"](../../../expansion-plan/skills-expansion/4.-skill-gated-ancient-blueprints.md)

### Telemetry (for tuning)

Track:

* XP/hour by skill and by cohort.
* Time-to-60 per skill.
* Time-to-99 distribution.\n Keep it rare.
* Total Level distribution vs zone access.
* Ability usage rates.\n Are `60+` skills “felt”?
* Build diversity.\n Branch selection splits.
