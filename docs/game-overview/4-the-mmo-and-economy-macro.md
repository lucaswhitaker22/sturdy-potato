# 4 - The MMO & Economy (Macro)

## Relic Vault: Part 4 — The MMO & Economy (Macro)

The Macro loop is what prevents _Relic Vault_ from being a lonely "clicker" game. By introducing player-to-player trade, competitive display, and a multi-tiered currency system, the game creates a living world where your "finds" have value to others.

***

### 4.1 The Bazaar (Auction House)

The Bazaar is the heart of the player economy. It is a text-heavy, high-speed interface where players compete for the best relics and raw materials.

* Listing Mechanics: Players can list items from their Vault. Listing requires a small Scrap deposit to prevent "listing spam."
*   The Global Ticker: A scrolling feed at the top of the Bazaar screen:

    > _NEWS: "User\_Alpha just listed \[Old World Smartphone #004] - Bidding starts at 50,000 Scrap!"_
* Historical Influence Buff: Players with high Appraisal levels can certify listings. Certified items reveal hidden bonuses.
* The Archive Tax: A flat 5% fee is deducted from all successful sales. This acts as a "money sink" to ensure the total amount of Scrap in the economy doesn't lead to runaway inflation.

***

### 4.2 The Global Museum (Social Leaderboard)

The Museum is a rotating, community-driven event. Every week, the "Archive" requests a specific theme (e.g., _Pre-Collapse Cleaning Supplies_ or _Ancient Entertainment Tech_).

#### The Museum Score Calculation

Players "Donating" items to the weekly exhibit earn a score based on rarity, condition, and set completion.

\$$MS = \sum (HV \times C) \times S\_{bonus}\$$

* $$ $HV$ $$: Base Historical Value of the item.
* $$ $C$ $$: Condition Multiplier (e.g., Mint = 2.5x).
* $$ $S_{bonus}$ $$: Set Multiplier (e.g., Full set = 1.5x).

#### Competitive Tiers & Rewards

At the end of the week, the Museum resets, and rewards are distributed based on leaderboard percentile:

* Top 1% (Grand Curator): Unique UI Badge, 500 Historical Influence, and a "Master Relic Key."
* Top 10% (Senior Researcher): 200 Historical Influence and 3 "Encapsulated Crates."
* Participation: 50 Historical Influence.

### 4.3 Currency Systems

_Relic Vault_ utilizes a "Tri-Currency" model to balance progression, monetization, and social standing.

| **Currency**         | **Type**       | **Primary Source**                | **Primary Use**                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Scrap                | Soft           | Digging, Smelting Junk            | Tool Upgrades, Skill Training, Bazaar Bidding.      |
| Vault Credits        | Hard/Premium   | Real-Money, Dissolving Prismatics | Trading for Top-Tier Relics, UI Skins, Charms.      |
| Historical Influence | Social (Fixed) | Museum Participation, Quests      | Unlocking New Dig Sites (Zones), High-Level Skills. |

### 4.4 OSRS-Inspired Skilling Integration

To drive the economy, certain skills are required to interact with Macro systems effectively. This creates "Specializations" (e.g., a player who is a master at finding items but bad at selling them).

#### The Macro-Skill Synergies:

* Appraisal (The Merchant Skill):
  * _Level 1-30:_ Can see basic Historical Value.
  * _Level 60:_ Can see "Mint Probability" before sifting.
  * _Level 99:_ "Master Trader"—Reduces Bazaar listing fees to 2.5% and unlocks the "Auctioneer" title.
* Restoration (The High-Roller Skill):
  * Directly affects the Museum Score. Higher Restoration skill gives a passive +1% bonus to the Historical Value of any item the player "claims" from a sift.
* Excavation (The Gatherer Skill):
  * High-level Excavators are the primary "suppliers" for the Bazaar. At Level 99, they have a chance to find "Unidentified Blueprints" which can be sold to other players to unlock new Workshop upgrades.
