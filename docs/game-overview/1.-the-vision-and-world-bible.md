# 1. The Vision & World Bible

## Relic Vault: Part 1 — Vision & World Bible

### 1.1 Elevator pitch

Relic Vault is a text-first scavenger clicker with MMO economy hooks.

You dig up forgotten artifacts.

You gamble on restoration.

You flex the best finds in the Archive.

### 1.2 Player fantasy

* Be the first to discover something “real.”
* Decide when to stop pushing your luck.
* Turn junk into status.
* Build a curated collection with meaning.

### 1.3 Design pillars

1. **Risk is readable.** The UI must telegraph stakes.
2. **Progress is permanent.** Skills outlive tools.
3. **Loot has identity.** Every relic has story weight.
4. **The economy is the endgame.** Finds matter to other players.
5. **Active play adds edges.** Optional micro interactions reward attention, not hours.

### 1.4 Tone and vibe

* Post-collapse archaeology.
* Clinical UI. Wasteland flavor.
* Dry humor in item notes.
* “The Archive” is serious and bureaucratic.

### 1.5 World rules (so writing stays consistent)

* The surface is dangerous and unstable.
* Survivors live in sealed “Vaults” and bunkers.
* The Archive is the institution that assigns value.
* The UI is diegetic. It’s your equipment and your world.

### 1.6 Key factions (lightweight)

* **The Archive:** Judges, taxes, and broadcasts discoveries.
* **Scavengers:** Players. Competitive. Superstitious about RNG.
* **Merchants:** Bazaar power-players who set price norms.
* **Lore Keepers:** Archive clerks who author Expeditions and requisitions.
* **Brokers:** Counter-Bazaar middlemen. They profit from chaos.

### 1.7 What a “relic” means

A relic is valuable because it is scarce, named, and socially recognized.

Value is a mix of:

* Rarity tier
* Condition
* Mint number
* Set membership
* Flavor and prestige

See [3 - The Loot & Collection Schema](3-the-loot-and-collection-schema.md).

### 1.8 Writing style for item flavor

Keep it short.

Write like a clueless researcher.

Use one strong joke.

Avoid modern slang.

Example pattern:

* **Item name**
  * **Research note:** One sentence of confident misinterpretation.

### 1.9 Glossary (terms used across docs)

* **Scrap:** Soft currency. Core progression spend.
* **Crate:** Unrefined drop. Needs Lab actions.
* **Sift:** Risk action that upgrades reward tier.
* **Shatter:** Failure state. The item is destroyed.
* **Fine Dust:** Shatter material. Also spent for Active Stabilization.
* **Perfect Survey:** A “hit the sweet spot” extraction result. Grants a one-action crate bonus.
* **Static Intensity:** Zone modifier. More crates, less lab stability for loot from that zone.
* **Overload Meter:** 3-segment meter filled by anomalies. Triggers a short “fever mode.”
* **Vault:** Your retained items and sets.
* **Bazaar:** Player market and trading UI.
* **Archive:** Weekly competition and social layer.
* **Counter-Bazaar:** High-risk market lane. 0% tax, confiscation risk.
* **Syndicate Permit:** Team-pooled HI unlock for temporary zone access.
* **Lease:** Temporary item loan. Item becomes `LEASED` and untradeable.
* **Endowment:** Permanent burn into the Archive’s Hall of Fame.
* **Static Pulse:** Macro-economic world event. Volatility in tax/yields.
* **Expedition / Requisition:** Archive contract asking for evidence turn-ins.
