# 5. "The Great Static" Events (incl. Static Pulses)

## "The Great Static" Events (incl. Static Pulses)

The Great Static is the world’s “weather system”.

It expresses as short-lived **World Events** that apply global mutators.

These events are triggered by normal gameplay outcomes.

They do **not** change the base 5% Anomaly outcome in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

### 3.1 Design goals

* Make the world feel reactive to player discoveries.
* Create time-boxed “return right now” reasons without power creep.
* Add macro volatility (tax, museum scoring, smelting) with clear UI.
* Provide hooks for social proof (global feed spikes, zone rushes).

Non-goals:

* Do not rewrite core RNG tables (Scrap/Crate/Anomaly odds, Lab odds).
* Do not hide modifiers or “secret math”.
* Do not create events that demand 24/7 play.

### 3.2 Definitions (keep the terms clean)

**Anomaly (loot outcome)**\
The 5% extraction result. This is an outcome roll, not an event by itself.

**World Event (mutator)**\
A server-owned timed state that modifies existing systems.

**Zone Event (localized mutator)**\
Like a World Event, but only applies inside one zone.

### 3.3 Event model (how events are represented)

Each event has:

* `event_id` (string)
* `scope`: `global` or `zone:<zone_id>`
* `start_at`, `end_at`
* `modifiers`: a small list of additive/multiplicative rules
* `broadcast_rule`: when to post in the global feed

Authority rules:

* Events are created and resolved server-side.
* Clients only render and apply the modifiers they are told.

### 3.4 Stacking + clamping rules (guardrails)

#### Rule A — Additive vs multiplicative

* **Crate chance** modifiers should be **flat/additive** (`+X%`).
* **Scrap generation** modifiers should be **multiplicative** (`×Y`).
* **Stability** modifiers should be **flat/additive** (`-X%`).

#### Rule B — Clamp crate chance

If any system adds to crate chance (zone static, Seismic Surge, events):

* `p_crate_final = min(p_crate_base + bonuses_flat, 95%)`

This keeps the ceiling sane.

#### Rule C — Never touch anomaly odds

Events must not modify the 5% Anomaly roll.

Events can change what Anomalies _do_ (e.g., Overload charging), but not how often they appear.

#### Rule D — One event per “category”

Avoid unreadable stacks.

Recommended categories:

* Economy (tax, smelting)
* Museum (score multipliers)
* Field (scrap, speed, crate chance)
* Lab (stability stings)

Allow at most 1 active event per category at a time.

### 3.5 UX requirements (so players trust the system)

Minimum UI:

* Persistent banner with:
  * event name
  * timer
  * 1–2 key effects
* Tap/click to expand “Full effects”.
* Every affected screen shows a small icon next to the modified value:
  * Bazaar: Tax %
  * Field: Scrap/tick, crate chance bonuses
  * Lab: Stability modifiers (if any)
  * Archive: Museum multiplier

Feed behavior:

* Start: global broadcast (“STATIC ALERT: …”).
* End: a clean close message.
* For zone events: broadcast to players currently in that zone + global ticker line.

### 3.6 Event catalog (initial set)

#### Event 1 — Magnetic Interference (Field + Overload synergy)

Fantasy: a static storm makes machinery “hot”.

Duration: `2–6 hours` (tune later).

Effects:

* Auto-Diggers: `scrap_per_tick × 2.0`
  * Crate chance unchanged.
* Overload charging: Anomaly → `+2` segments (clamped at 3).
  * This uses the existing rule in [Anomaly Overload](../micro-loop-expansion/3.-anomaly-overload-the-combo-meter.md).

Optional sting (keep it additive and obvious):

* Lab Stability penalty for **Electronics-tagged** items: `-5%` flat.
  * Apply after Restoration bonuses.
  * Clamp final Stability to a sensible floor (recommend `min 1%`).

#### Event 2 — Archive Audit (Economy + Museum)

Fantasy: the Archive clamps down, but pays for compliance.

Duration: `24 hours`.

Effects:

* Bazaar Archive Tax: `10%` (up from 5%).
  * Must remain server-calculated (integrity).
  * Appraisal 99 tax reduction rules should still apply as a multiplier/override.
    * Example implementation: apply mastery reduction to the current tax, not to a hard-coded 5%.
* Museum Score: `× 2.0` (final multiplier step).
  * This should be explicit in the Archive UI.

Anti-feels-bad:

* Announce the start time at least 60 minutes in advance (global feed).
* See “Advanced warning” below for Appraisal gating.

#### Event 3 — Discovery Gold Rush (Zone-local chase)

Fantasy: a rare discovery sends everyone running to the same ruins.

Trigger:

* A **Unique** reveal occurs (Quantum Reveal success).

Scope:

* **Zone-local**: only players currently extracting in the same zone as the reveal.

Duration:

* `60 minutes`.

Effects:

* Crate chance bonus: `+5%` **flat** in that zone.
* No changes to:
  * Anomaly odds
  * Lab odds
  * Mint odds

Clamping:

* Clamp crate chance as usual: `≤ 95%`.

#### Event 4 — Industrial Boom (Macro-Economic Static Pulse)

Fantasy: factories re-awaken. Refiners run hot.

Duration: `12–24 hours`.

Effects:

* Smelting yield: `× 2.0`.\n
* Bazaar Archive Tax: `10%` (up from 5%).\n Appraisal mastery reductions apply to the current tax.\n
* No changes to:\n
  * Anomaly odds\n
  * Mint odds\n
  * Lab rarity odds

#### Event 5 — Resource Drought (Macro-Economic Static Pulse)

Fantasy: the surface goes quiet. The Archive overpays for proof.

Duration: `12–24 hours`.

Effects:

* Crate drop chance: `× 0.5` (applied after flat bonuses, then clamped).\n
* Museum submissions HV: `× 3.0` for scoring only.\n
* No changes to:\n
  * Anomaly odds\n
  * Mint odds\n
  * Lab stability tables

### 3.7 Advanced warning (Appraisal “intel edge”)

For economy-scale events (Audit, devaluation pulses, etc.), allow a warning edge:

* Appraisal `90+` gets a `60m` early warning in a private feed line.
* Everyone else gets the normal broadcast at event start.

This matches the “intel + efficiency” fantasy without handing out free outcomes.

### 3.8 Integrity + anti-abuse constraints

* Events must be deterministic and logged.
* Do not let clients “predict” or self-apply the effects.
* For zone events, eligibility is based on:
  * current zone at action time (server-side), not “UI selection”.
* Avoid “log in, claim, log out” exploitation:
  * If an event affects passive systems, decide explicitly:
    * either apply while offline (then cap it), or
    * online-only (recommended for volatility).

### 3.9 Telemetry (so tuning is real)

Track per event:

* Participation rate (players affected / total active).
* Delta in:
  * Scrap/hour
  * Crates/hour
  * Bazaar volume
  * Museum submissions/hour
* For Gold Rush:
  * zone population spike
  * average session length during event

Use this to tune:

* durations
* bonus sizes (`×2`, `+5%`, etc.)
* category stacking limits

### 3.10 Implementation notes (phased)

* Phase 3: event broadcasting + one simple global event (Audit).
* Phase 4: zone events (Gold Rush) + Overload synergy events (Interference).
* Phase 5+: richer catalog + macro “Static Pulses” from the expansion plan.

Server-authoritative requirements:

* Events table (id, scope, start/end, modifiers JSON).
* One “modifier resolver” that computes final values in one place.
* Realtime broadcast channel for start/end + banner updates.
