# 1. The "Counter-Bazaar" (Black Market Trading)

## The "Counter-Bazaar" (Black Market Trading)

The Counter-Bazaar is a parallel market lane.

It trades safety for upside.

It must not change canonical loot odds.

### Design goals

* Create a meaningful choice versus the normal Bazaar.
* Reward Appraisal as risk reduction.
* Add an item sink that feels diegetic.

Non-goals:

* No extra drop rates.
* No free information.

### Core rules

Baseline comparison:

* **Bazaar**: `5%` Archive Tax. Low risk.
* **Counter-Bazaar**: `0%` Archive Tax. High risk.

#### Confiscation Risk

Each active Counter-Bazaar listing rolls a confiscation check.

* Rate: `2%` per `24h` the listing remains active.
* Check timing: once per 24h window.
* On confiscation:
  * The item is removed from escrow.
  * The seller receives no payout.
  * The listing closes.

{% hint style="info" %}
This creates a real sink. It also keeps “0% tax” from being dominant.
{% endhint %}

### Appraisal integration

Appraisal reduces risk.

* Appraisal reduces confiscation risk by a small flat amount.
  * Example tuning: `-0.25%` per 10 Appraisal levels.
* Appraisal 99 (“Master Trader”) unlocks **Under-the-Table** listings.
  * These are Counter-Bazaar listings hidden from non-masters.

### UI requirements

Location: \[04] THE BAZAAR.

Minimum UI:

* Mode toggle: **Bazaar / Counter-Bazaar**.
* Listing badge: `COUNTER`.
* Timer and next confiscation check time.
* A clear warning line on create-listing.

### Anti-abuse constraints

* Counter-Bazaar listings still require a Scrap deposit.
* Confiscation rolls are server-side.
* Sellers cannot cancel within the last 5 minutes (optional).
