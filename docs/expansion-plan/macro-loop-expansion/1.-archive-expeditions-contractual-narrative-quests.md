# 1. Archive Expeditions (Contractual Narrative Quests)

The Archive is described as a serious, bureaucratic institution that assigns value to items. A quest system could formalize this relationship.

* Research Requisitions: Periodic "Archive Contracts" could appear in the Archive deck, requesting specific items with certain conditions (e.g., "Three _Preserved_ Soda Tabs").
* Lore Rewards: Completing contracts could reward players with "Archive Clearance" (a temporary buff to hidden sub-stat visibility and better Appraisal previews) or unique "Vault Research Notes" that reveal more about "The Great Static".
* Rank Progression: Players could earn specific titles like "Junior Clerk" or "Lead Pathologist" that modify their interaction with the Bazaar or Museum.
