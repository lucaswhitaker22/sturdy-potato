# 1. Archive Expeditions (Contractual Narrative Quests)

## Archive Expeditions (Contractual Narrative Quests)

Archive Expeditions turn the Archive into a “quest board”.

They are bureaucratic contracts that ask for specific evidence.

They create long-term targets without changing core drop odds in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

### 1.1 Design goals

* Add directed goals to the macro loop (weeks), not just “farm best zone”.
* Create an **item sink** that feels diegetic (submitted relics leave the economy).
* Reward Appraisal as “intel + efficiency”, not as “free perfect information”.
* Surface world lore via “Research Notes”, not cutscenes.

Non-goals:

* Do not alter base RNG tables (crate/anomaly odds, mint odds, rarity odds).
* Do not reveal exact mint math or exact catalog IDs for free.
* Do not create a mandatory daily checklist.

### 1.2 Where it lives (UI + state)

Location: \[05] ARCHIVE (same deck as the weekly Museum loop in [0 - Game Loop](../../game-overview/0-game-loop.md)).

Add a sub-panel: **CONTRACTS / EXPEDITIONS**.

Minimum UI:

* List of available contracts (with expiry timers).
* “Accept” / “Track” toggles (max tracked: 3).
* Progress chips per requirement (0/3, 1/2, etc.).
* “Turn in” flow that consumes items from the Vault.

State rules:

* Players can have **1 active Expedition** at a time.
* Players can hold **up to 3** accepted contracts total.
* Contracts rotate on a fixed cadence (daily + weekly pools).

### 1.3 Contract types (use one system, multiple templates)

#### Type A — Research Requisitions (item turn-ins)

The Archive requests specific relics with constraints.

Examples:

* “3× Soda Tab — **Preserved+**”
* “1× AA Battery — **Mint Condition**”
* “2× any item from **The Digital Dark Age** set”

#### Type B — Field Orders (activity requirements)

These are “do the work” objectives that don’t require specific items.

Examples:

* Complete 20 manual \[EXTRACT] actions in a HIGH Static zone.
* Successfully \[SIFT] to Stage 3+ five times (any crate).
* Trigger 3 Anomalies (does not change anomaly odds).

#### Type C — Dossiers (hybrid: do X, then submit Y)

This is the “narrative” version. It reads like a case file.

Example chain:

1. Recover “any **Rare+** electronic item” (evidence).
2. Complete 10 Lab sifts without a Critical Fail (procedure).
3. Submit 1 relic tagged “Primitive Tech” (final report).

### 1.4 Requirement language (what a contract can ask for)

Keep constraints aligned with the item schema in [3 - The Loot & Collection Schema](../../game-overview/3-the-loot-and-collection-schema.md).

Each requirement is defined as:

* **Target**
  * Specific item name (catalog ID behind the scenes), **or**
  * Set name, **or**
  * A broad tag/category (“Ritualistic Objects”, “Primitive Tech”, etc.).
* **Quantity**
* **Constraints** (optional)
  * Rarity minimum (e.g., Rare+)
  * Condition minimum (Weathered+ / Preserved+ / Mint Condition)
  * Mint cap (e.g., “Mint #≤100”) for rare “flex” requisitions
  * Prismatic required (rare, endgame-only)
* **Source rules**
  * Procurement: items can be bought from the Bazaar.
  * Verified Finds: items must be found by the player after accepting.

Use Procurement for most contracts.

Use Verified Finds sparingly for “story beats” and prestige tiers.

### 1.5 Player flow (accept → complete → submit)

1. Player opens \[05] ARCHIVE → CONTRACTS.
2. Player accepts a contract (locks it until expiry or completion).
3. Progress updates automatically:
   * Item requirements update when matching items enter the Vault.
   * Activity requirements tick on action completion.
4. Player turns in items from the Vault.
5. Contract resolves:
   * Rewards granted.
   * Submitted items are consumed (sink).
   * A Research Note unlocks (if applicable).

### 1.6 Rewards

Rewards should hit three buckets: progression, information, prestige.

#### Progression rewards (economic)

Pick 1–2 per contract:

* Scrap payout (scales by difficulty band).
* Historical Influence (HI) payout (small for daily, meaningful for weekly).
* Vault Credits (rare; use for higher-tier expeditions only).

#### Information rewards (the “Archive Clearance” buff)

**Archive Clearance** is a time-boxed intel buff.

It must stay consistent with Pre-Sift Appraisal.

Allowed effects:

* Upgrade preview **bands → more precise bands**.
  * Example: “80% Preserved+” becomes “80–90% Preserved+”.
* Add one extra Appraisal preview line for crates while the buff lasts.
  * Example: show both Condition Range and Mint Probability band.

Not allowed:

* Exact mint probability numbers.
* Exact outcome guarantees.
* Free reveal of catalog IDs or hidden sub-stats across the board.

Recommended duration: `30–120 minutes`.

#### Prestige rewards (social + long-term)

* Titles tied to the Archive hierarchy (e.g., Junior Clerk → Lead Pathologist).
* Cosmetic UI stamps for contract completion (“FILED”, “SEALED”, “APPROVED”).
* Permanent “Research Note” entries that build lore about “The Great Static”.

Tie the tier ladder into [Influence-Gated Social Tiers](2.-influence-gated-social-tiers-macro-loop-expansion.md).

### 1.7 Difficulty bands (simple tuning model)

Use clear bands so balancing stays sane:

* **Daily / Routine**: common items, low constraints, small HI.
* **Weekly / Casework**: specific conditions or Rare+ asks, meaningful HI.
* **Special / Audit**: mint cap, prismatic asks, Verified Finds, titles.

Rule of thumb:

* If it requires “Mint #≤X” or Prismatic, it must be optional prestige.

### 1.8 Economy + anti-abuse constraints

#### Preserve canonical odds

Contracts never modify:

* Crate drop rate.
* Anomaly chance.
* Lab rarity/stability tables.
* Mint assignment.

They only change what players _choose_ to pursue and _what they burn_.

#### Avoid market cornering

Mitigations:

* Prefer category/set-based asks over single named items.
* If using named items, randomize per-player from a pool.
* Limit “high-demand” requisitions per rotation.

#### Sink design

Turn-ins should always consume items.

Exception (rare): “Lease and verify” style objectives should return the item.

If the item returns, the reward must be mostly prestige, not currency.

### 1.9 World hooks (events + anomalies)

Expeditions are a clean hook for world mutators like [“The Great Static” Anomalies](3.-the-great-static-anomalies-world-event-expansion.md).

Examples:

* During “Archive Audit”, weekly Casework pays +50% HI (no RNG changes).
* During “Magnetic Interference”, Field Orders lean toward anomaly tasks.

### 1.10 Implementation notes (phased rollout)

* Phase 2: Type A only (Research Requisitions).
* Phase 3: Add Type B (Field Orders) + simple Dossiers.
* Phase 4: Add multi-step narrative chains + unique Research Notes.

Keep server-authoritative validation for:

* “Verified Find” provenance stamps.
* Turn-in consumption.
* Reward payouts (HI, credits).
