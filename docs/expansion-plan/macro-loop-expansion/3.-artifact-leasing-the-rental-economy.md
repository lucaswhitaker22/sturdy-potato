# 3. Artifact Leasing (The Rental Economy)

## Artifact Leasing (The Rental Economy)

Leasing lets players borrow a relic temporarily.

It solves “one missing set piece”.

It creates a new macro economy lane.

### Design goals

* Reduce dead-end frustration in Set Completion.
* Create a sink/source for duplicate low-mint and prismatic items.
* Add an economic role for collectors.

Non-goals:

* No duplication exploits.
* No bypassing core progression gates.

### Core mechanic

An owner creates a **Lease Offer** for a specific item.

Lease params:

* Duration: `1h`, `24h`, `72h` (tune later).
* Fee: Scrap (always) and optionally Vault Credits (late game).

On accept:

* The item moves to the borrower’s Vault.
* The item is marked `LEASED`.

While leased, the borrower cannot:

* Sell or list the item.
* Smelt or dissolve the item.
* Donate/endow the item.
* Use it in Museum submissions.

On expiry:

* The item auto-returns to the owner’s Vault.
* Any temporary buffs end.

### Set + buff integration

Leased items can count toward:

* **Temporary set completion**.

Rules:

* The set buff applies only for the lease duration.
* The set does not become “permanently locked”.
* The borrower cannot “lock” a leased item into a permanent set.

### Appraisal integration

Appraisal can improve trust and discovery.

* Appraisal 60+ can show an extra preview line on Lease Offers.
  * Example: “Hidden sub-stat revealed”.

### Market integrity rules

* One active lease per item.
* Items in escrow or Museum lock cannot be leased.
* Leases are server-authoritative.

### UI requirements

Location: \[03] THE VAULT + \[04] THE BAZAAR.

Minimum UI:

* **Lease** action in item detail.
* Lease Offer card in the Bazaar.
* Clear lock icons for `LEASED` items.
