# 2. Influence-Gated Social Tiers (and Syndicate Excavations)

## Influence-Gated Social Tiers (and Syndicate Excavations)

Social Tiers are the Archive’s bureaucracy as progression.

They convert **Historical Influence (HI)** into permanent status perks.

They should feel OSRS-like: clear ranks, small functional edges, big flex.

Canon references:

* HI definitions and uses: [4 - The MMO & Economy (Macro)](../../game-overview/4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/)
* Macro loop placement: [0 - Game Loop](../../game-overview/0-game-loop.md)
* Bazaar mechanics + certification: [4 - The MMO & Economy (Macro)](../../game-overview/4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro/)

### 2.1 Design goals

* Make HI matter outside the weekly Museum payout.
* Give players persistent “social power” without breaking the economy.
* Reward consistency, not just one lucky Unique reveal.
* Create visible identity (badges, titles) that shows in Bazaar + Archive.

Non-goals:

* Do not replace Appraisal mastery perks (e.g., tax reductions).
* Do not add raw loot multipliers.
* Do not create a pay-to-win path (HI is non-tradable).

### 2.2 Where it lives (UI + state)

Location: \[05] ARCHIVE.

Add a sub-panel: **STATUS / TIERS**.

Minimum UI:

* Current Rank card (badge, title, perks summary).
* Next Rank requirements and one-click “Apply for Promotion”.
* A small “Archive Seal” icon next to the username globally:
  * Bazaar listings
  * Museum leaderboard
  * Global feed pings

State rules:

* Ranks are **permanent unlocks**.
* Promotions are **one-time HI spends** (a sink).
* Rank gates can be layered onto future content (contracts, permits, displays).

### 2.3 Rank ladder (recommended tuning)

Keep the ladder short and legible.

If you add more tiers later, keep the perk delta small.

#### Rank 0 — Scavenger

Baseline access.

No tier perks.

#### Rank 1 — Archive Clerk (`1,000 HI`)

Unlock: spend `1,000 HI` once.

Perks:

* Bazaar Watchlist: track up to **5** listings.
* Push notifications for watched listing state changes:
  * “Outbid”
  * “Auction ended”
  * “Buyout triggered” (if implemented)

#### Rank 2 — Senior Pathologist (`5,000 HI`)

Unlock: spend `5,000 HI` once.

Perks:

* **Certification Voucher**: certify **1** item for free every `24h`.
  * This waives the Scrap fee only.
  * It does not bypass Appraisal requirements.
* Bazaar Watchlist cap increases to **15**.

#### Rank 3 — High Curator (`20,000 HI`)

Unlock: spend `20,000 HI` once.

Perks:

* **Master’s Gallery**: public-facing display deck for your best finds.
  * Display up to **10** items.
  * Displayed items are not locked.
  * They can still be sold in the Bazaar.
  * If sold, they auto-remove from the gallery.
* “Curator” badge shown on:
  * Your Bazaar profile header
  * Your Museum submissions screen

{% hint style="info" %}
These are macro perks. They must not outperform skill mastery. Appraisal Level 99 still owns the tax-reduction lane.
{% endhint %}

### 2.4 Perk mechanics (exact rules)

#### Bazaar Watchlist (notifications)

Watched object: a single Bazaar listing.

Watchlist events to notify:

* Listing receives a new top bid.
* The player is outbid.
* Auction is settled (win/lose).
* Listing is cancelled by seller (if cancellation exists).

Spam control:

* Collapse multiple bid events into one notification per `60s` per listing.
* Let users mute per-listing notifications.

Integrity:

* Notifications should be server-triggered (Realtime + queue).
* Do not trust client timers for “auction ended” states.

#### Certification Voucher (free certify)

This perk should align with certification in the Bazaar.

Rules:

* Voucher grants **one free certification** per rolling `24h` window.
* Voucher only waives **the Scrap fee**.
* The player must still meet the Appraisal requirement to certify.
  * If certification requires Appraisal 60+, keep it that way.
* Certification outcome stays identical:
  * Adds “Certified” badge.
  * Reveals whatever certification normally reveals (sub-stats, etc.).

Avoid power creep:

* Voucher does not reduce Archive Tax.
* Voucher does not increase sell price directly.

#### Master’s Gallery (public display)

The Gallery is social proof, not a storage system.

Rules:

* Gallery is a curated view into the player’s Vault.
* Display slots store references to item IDs.
* Displaying does not lock items.
* If an item becomes locked elsewhere (e.g., assigned to Museum):
  * It can still appear in the Gallery.
  * Show a “LOCKED (Museum)” tag.
* If the item leaves the Vault (sold, dissolved, endowed):
  * Remove it automatically.

Recommended sorting/filters:

* Default: highest HV first.
* Optional toggles: “Low Mint”, “Prismatic”, “Most Recent”.

### 2.5 Integration hooks (why tiers matter)

These ranks become clean gates for future macro systems:

* Rank 1+: unlocks “Tracked” contract UI for [Archive Expeditions](6.-lore-keeper-requisitions-archive-expeditions.md).
* Rank 2+: unlocks one extra Bazaar listing slot (optional later).
* Rank 3+: unlocks “Curator Notes” on Gallery items (1-line flavor text).

Keep gates soft.

Never hard-block core progression behind rank.

### 2.6 Balance + anti-abuse

* HI is non-tradable.
  * These perks should never be sellable or transferrable.
* Watchlist is an info edge.
  * Cap it hard to avoid “market bot” behavior.
* Voucher is a fee edge.
  * Keep it as a small daily relief, not a permanent discount.
* Gallery is social.
  * It should not increase Museum Score or Bazaar valuation directly.

### 2.7 Implementation notes (phased rollout)

* Phase 4: Rank 1 + Rank 2 (Watchlist + Voucher).
* Phase 5+: Rank 3 (Gallery) once profiles and item references are stable.

Server-side requirements:

* Rank unlocks and cooldowns stored in Postgres.
* Notifications emitted from authoritative auction settlement.

### 2.8 Syndicate Excavations (Cooperative Social Goals)

Syndicate Excavations are team-scale HI spending.\n They unlock temporary access, not raw loot multipliers.

#### The mechanic (Syndicate Permit)

Teams pool HI to fund a **Syndicate Permit**.

* Permit duration: `48 hours`.\n
* Permit effect: unlocks one high-tier zone for all Syndicate members.\n
* Permit is consumed on activation (HI sink).

#### Requirements

* Leader Total Level gate (zone-specific).\n
* Minimum Syndicate size (tune later).\n
* A per-member HI contribution (prevents one whale carrying everyone).

#### Macro impact

* HI becomes a community lever.\n
* It creates coordination goals.\n
* It makes “zone access” a social flex.

#### Integrity rules

* Access is checked server-side per action.\n
* Leaving the Syndicate removes access immediately.\n
* Permits never modify base drop odds.\n They only change where players are allowed to extract.
