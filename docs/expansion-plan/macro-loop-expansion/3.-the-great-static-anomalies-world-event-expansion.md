# 3. "The Great Static" Anomalies (World Event Expansion)

#### 6. "The Great Static" Anomalies (World Event Expansion)

Fleshing out the 5% Anomaly chance and World Events, these create short-term "Mutators" for all players.

* Magnetic Interference:
  * Auto-Diggers generate double Scrap.
  * Anomalies charge the **Overload Meter** twice as fast (pairs with “Anomaly Overload”).
  * Optional extra sting: Lab Stability for electronic items can be reduced (keep it a clear, additive modifier).
* Archive Audit: A 24-hour window where the Archive Tax is temporarily increased to 10%, but all Museum scores are doubled.
* Discovery Gold Rush:
  * Trigger: a Unique reveal.
  * For 60 minutes, players currently in the same Zone gain `+5%` **flat** Crate drop rate.
  * This should not change Anomaly odds.
  * Clamp the final crate chance as usual (avoid >95% scenarios).
