Using Historical Influence (HI), players can climb a social hierarchy that provides functional perks.

* The Clerical Tiers:
  * Scavenger (Rank 0): Base access.
  * Archive Clerk (Rank 1 - 1,000 HI): Unlocks the ability to "Watch" up to 5 Bazaar listings with real-time push notifications.
  * Senior Pathologist (Rank 2 - 5,000 HI): Grants a dedicated "Certification" slot in the Bazaar, allowing the player to certify one item for free every 24 hours.
