# 4. Museum Endowments (Permanent Prestige)

## Museum Endowments (Permanent Prestige)

Endowments are a permanent item sink.

They convert top-tier relics into long-term prestige.

### Design goals

* Preserve digital scarcity over years.
* Give whales and grinders a non-market flex.
* Create permanent social proof beyond weekly Museum rotations.

Non-goals:

* No power creep through raw loot multipliers.
* No reclaiming endowed items.

### Core mechanic

A player may **Endow** an item into the Archive’s permanent collection.

* The item is permanently burned.
* The item appears in a world-visible **Hall of Fame** entry.

Recommended eligibility:

* Mythic+ or Unique only.
* Not leased.
* Not in Bazaar escrow.
* Not currently locked in the weekly Museum.

### Rewards

Endowment grants:

* Permanent account-wide `+1%` **Museum Score multiplier**.
* A unique **Patron** title.
* A permanent Archive record entry.

Keep the bonus small. This is an item sink, not a new progression track.

### UI requirements

Location: \[05] ARCHIVE → Museum.

Minimum UI:

* Endow button in item detail (if eligible).
* Confirmation modal with burn warning.
* Hall of Fame panel (filterable by rarity, low mint).

### Economy integration

* Endowed items are removed from trade forever.
* This offsets late-game mint saturation.

* Museum scoring: [4 - The MMO & Economy (Macro)](../../game-overview/4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro.md)
* Scarcity fields (mint/condition): [3 - The Loot & Collection Schema](../../game-overview/3-the-loot-and-collection-schema/)
