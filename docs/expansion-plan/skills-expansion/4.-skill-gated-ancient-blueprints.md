#### 4. Skill-Gated "Ancient Blueprints"

Building on the Excavation Mastery concept, high-level players could find and "Appraise" blueprints to unlock unique UI features.

* UI Blueprints: At high Appraisal levels, players find blueprints for custom Vault icons, unique progress bar animations, or specialized "Sift" sound effects.
* Tool Blueprints: Excavators (Level 99) can find blueprints for "Prototype Tools" that must be crafted using Smelting and high volumes of Fine Dust.
