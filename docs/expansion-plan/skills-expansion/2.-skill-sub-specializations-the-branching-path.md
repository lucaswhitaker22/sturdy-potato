# 2. Skill Sub-Specializations (The Branching Path)

## Skill Sub-Specializations (The Branching Path)

Sub-specializations are “build choices” for each skill.

They unlock at level 60 and push players into distinct late-game roles.

They must not contradict the canonical odds in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics/).

### 2.1 Design goals

* Create meaningful builds beyond “every skill is the same”.
* Reinforce class fantasy:
  * Excavation = targeting and throughput
  * Restoration = risk management
  * Appraisal = intel and trust
  * Smelting = material efficiency
* Keep choices readable in UI. No hidden math.
* Make specializations impactful, but not required.

Non-goals:

* Do not change the base extraction outcome odds (Scrap/Crate/Anomaly).
* Do not change stage rarity tables.
* Do not add a new currency.
* Do not create irreversible “wrong build” traps.

### 2.2 Unlock rules (Level 60 “branch pick”)

At skill level `60`, the player chooses **one** branch for that skill.

Rules:

* Each skill has exactly one active branch at a time.
* Branch choice is persistent.
* The UI must show:
  * chosen branch name
  * effects (exact)
  * respec cost and cooldown (if allowed)

{% hint style="info" %}
This matches the “advanced skilling starts at 60+” pacing used elsewhere.
{% endhint %}

### 2.3 Respec rules (recommended)

Respec keeps experimentation safe.

Recommended model:

* Respec cost: `25,000` Scrap (tunable).
* Respec cooldown: `7 days`.
* Respec is per-skill (you can respec Excavation without touching others).

Hard rules:

* Respec cannot refund spent items.
* Respec cannot be used mid-action (no swapping during a Lab run).

### 2.4 Where it lives (UI + state)

Location: \[03] THE VAULT skill dashboard (see [6 - UI/UX Wireframe & Flow](../../game-overview/6-ui-ux-wireframe-and-flow.md)).

Minimum UI:

* Skill detail panel includes a **Specialization** section.
* Two selectable cards per skill:
  * branch name
  * 1-sentence fantasy
  * bullet effects
* A confirm step that states:
  * “This choice is persistent.”
  * “You can respec later for Scrap.”

Authority rules:

* Branch state is stored server-side.
* Effects are applied server-side.

### 2.5 Specialization catalog (initial)

All numbers below are tuning suggestions.

They must remain explicit and clamp where relevant.

#### Excavation branches

Excavation branches should bias _what you chase_, not rewrite the core outcome odds.

**A) Urban Scavenger**

Fantasy: you’re a volume scavenger in everyday ruins.

Effect (loot identity bias):

* When an item is rolled from an eligible pool, increase weight toward:
  * `Household`
  * `Branded`

Implementation note:

* Apply this after rarity/stage is decided.\ This avoids changing rarity odds.

Optional secondary perk:

* \[EXTRACT] manual actions refund `5%` of their cooldown time (time-only).

**B) Tech Hunter**

Fantasy: you specialize in complex remnants and “high signal” artifacts.

Effect (loot identity bias):

* Increase weight toward:
  * `Complex Tech`
  * `Cultural Touchstones`

Guardrail:

* This must not increase Unique odds or Mint odds.\ It only affects identity within a rolled rarity.

#### Restoration branches

Restoration branches can modify risk, but must stay additive and visible.

**A) Stable Hand**

Fantasy: consistent, low-variance refining.

Effect:

* Add flat Stability bonus at early stages:
  * Stage 1–3: `+3%` Stability (flat)

Rules:

* Do not affect Stage 4–5 (keep endgame tension intact).
* Clamp stability as usual (`≤ 100%`).

**B) Quantum Gambler**

Fantasy: you live for the deep push.

Effect:

* Add flat Stability bonus at late stages:
  * Stage 4: `+2%` Stability
  * Stage 5: `+2%` Stability

Guardrails:

* This does not change stage rarity tables.
* It stacks with Restoration’s baseline per-level scaling (still clamped).

#### Appraisal branches

Appraisal branches should focus on “trust + intel”, not free outcomes.

**A) Certified Valuator**

Fantasy: you’re the server’s trusted signature.

Effect:

* Certification fee discount: `-25%` Scrap cost to certify (tunable).
* Certified items gain a small, explicit HV bonus:
  * `+2%` HV when you certify the item (once per item).

Guardrails:

* Must not stack infinitely (apply once per item).
* Must show the HV delta in the certification UI.

**B) Economic Insider**

Fantasy: you see the market a bit earlier than others.

Effect:

* Adds a short early-warning channel for:
  * Museum theme rollover announcements
  * “Static shift” zone heatmap updates

Recommended timing:

* `5m` early warning for insiders.

Alignment notes:

* Economy-scale world event warnings remain gated by Appraisal `90+` (see the “Advanced warning” rules in ["The Great Static" Events](../macro-loop-expansion/5.-the-great-static-events-incl.-static-pulses.md)).
* This branch is the “small edge”.\ The 90+ warning is the “big edge”.

#### Smelting branches

Smelting branches should emphasize either salvage mastery or raw yield.

**A) Fragment Alchemist**

Fantasy: failures become inputs.

Effect (default, no canon conflicts):

* If [Shatter Salvage](../micro-loop-expansion/5.-shatter-salvage-the-reaction-beat.md) exists:
  * Salvage window duration `+0.25s`.
  * On Stage `3+` Standard Fail, Fine Dust payout `+10%` (multiplicative).

Optional (only if you’re willing to update canon):

* Increase the base Cursed Fragment roll chance on Stage `3+` shatters.\ If you do this, update the base chance in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics/).

**B) Scrap Tycoon**

Fantasy: you are the Scrap economy.

Effect:

* Junk-tier smelt output: `× 1.25` (multiplicative).

Guardrail:

* Must stack cleanly with Smelting 99 (“Pure Yield”).
* Cap final Junk multiplier if needed (recommend max `× 3.0` total).

### 2.6 Integrity constraints (do not violate these)

* Any specialization that touches “chance” must be:
  * visible, and
  * additive/multiplicative in a defined order.
* Do not introduce new failure types.\ Lab failures remain Standard Fail vs Critical Fail (canonical).
* Do not let specializations bypass the tray-full lockout or other core gates.

### 2.7 Telemetry (so tuning is real)

Track:

* Branch pick distribution by skill and by level band.
* Respec rate (are builds “sticky”?).
* Lab outcomes:
  * stability deltas by branch
  * shatter rate changes at Stage 4–5 (Quantum Gambler)
* Economy outcomes:
  * Scrap/hour changes (Scrap Tycoon)
  * Cursed Fragment recovered per 1,000 shatters (Fragment Alchemist)
  * certification volume and HV delta (Certified Valuator)
* Retention/engagement:
  * do insiders log in around theme changes?
