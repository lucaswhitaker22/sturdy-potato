# 3. Cross-Skill Masteries (Synergy Unlocks)

## Cross-Skill Masteries (Synergy Unlocks)

Cross-Skill Masteries are late-game, always-on perks.

They unlock when specific skill pairs hit high levels.

They reward balanced progression without changing core odds.

### Design goals

* Reward “cross-training” beyond single-skill builds.
* Create readable, permanent unlock moments (OSRS vibes).
* Add small efficiency and identity perks, not power creep.
* Keep all core RNG canonical in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics/).

Non-goals:

* Do not change extraction odds (Scrap / Crate / Anomaly).
* Do not change Lab success odds (Stability %).
* Do not create hidden multipliers or opaque math.
* Do not introduce a new currency.

### Unlock rules (clean and deterministic)

#### Pair masteries

* A **pair mastery** unlocks when both skills reach the required level.
* Unlocks are account-level and permanent (until a Prestige reset exists).
* Effects are passive. No “equip slots” by default.

Default threshold:

* `80 / 80` for pair masteries.

#### Total mastery

* “All skills” masteries unlock off Total Level.
* Default threshold: **all four skills 90+** (Total Level `360`).

{% hint style="info" %}
If Appraisal/Smelting are capped at 90 without an HI unlock, this still works.
{% endhint %}

#### Prestige / Rebirth interaction (if shipped)

If [Archive Rebirth](../skills-expansion.md) exists:

* Masteries that require a reset skill should **deactivate** until re-earned.
* Cosmetic “Ribbon” rewards remain (they are the point of rebirth).

### Where it lives (UI + signaling)

Location: Skill UI (where levels are shown).

Minimum UI:

* A **Masteries** panel listing:
  * Locked masteries (greyed)
  * Unlocked masteries (lit)
  * Exact requirements and exact effect text
* A “new mastery unlocked” toast + log line.

Social signaling (optional, but strong):

* Small mastery badges on:
  * Bazaar identity surfaces
  * Museum leaderboard rows

### Mastery catalog (initial set)

All effects below must be server-authoritative.

They should be additive, small, and clearly shown in UI.

#### Excavation + Restoration (80 / 80) — “Field Conservator”

Fantasy: you recover better because you know how things break.

Effect:

* In the Lab, the **first** `[TETHER]` each Sift attempt has a `25%` chance to refund `1` Fine Dust.
* Refunds never exceed `1` per Sift attempt.

This integrates with [Active Stabilization (Lab Triage)](../micro-loop-expansion/2.-active-stabilization-lab-triage.md).

#### Excavation + Appraisal (80 / 80) — “Chain of Custody”

Fantasy: you can prove where it came from.

Effect:

* Items you personally excavated cost `-10%` Scrap to certify.
* Certification scope stays canonical (see Phase 4 R16).\ If sharing isn’t shipped, this still works for self-owned items.

#### Excavation + Smelting (80 / 80) — “Efficiency Engine”

Fantasy: you run the whole operation, not one station.

Effect:

* Auto-Diggers generate `+5%` more Scrap (multiplicative).
* While the player is **online**, Auto-Diggers have a `0.5%` chance per hour (tunable) to generate `+1` Fine Dust.

Hard rules:

* Fine Dust generation is online-only.
* This does not modify extraction odds.

#### Restoration + Appraisal (80 / 80) — “Certified Restorer”

Fantasy: your restorations are trusted (and worth more).

Effect:

* If an item is **restored by you** and **certified by you**:
  * add `+5%` HV to the item.

Guardrails:

* Apply at most once per item.
* Show the HV delta in the certification UI.
* If Museum scoring uses HV, the bonus should apply there too.

#### Restoration + Smelting (80 / 80) — “Salvage Scientist”

Fantasy: you know how to pull value from failure.

Effect:

* If [Shatter Salvage](../micro-loop-expansion/5.-shatter-salvage-the-reaction-beat.md) exists:
  * increase salvage window by `+0.25s`.
* If Shatter Salvage does **not** exist:
  * Standard Fail Fine Dust payout is `+10%` (multiplicative).

Hard rule:

* This never affects Success odds or stage tables.

#### Appraisal + Smelting (80 / 80) — “Industrial Broker”

Fantasy: refiners who understand markets waste less time.

Effect:

* Bulk Auto-Smelt grants Appraisal XP equal to `5%` of Smelting XP earned by that batch.
* Cap this bonus to prevent “XP loops”.
  * Recommended cap: `1` Appraisal level worth of XP per day.

### Total mastery (all skills 90+) — “Senior Researcher”

Fantasy: you’re now part of the Archive’s inner circle.

Effect:

* Unlock a **Research Notes** panel in the Archive deck.
* Research Notes grants:
  * early preview of the next Museum Theme (`60m` early), and
  * one cosmetic badge shown next to your name in Museum leaderboards.

Hard rules:

* This is intel + identity.
* It does not change rewards, scoring math, or drop rates.

### Integrity constraints (do not violate these)

* Any mastery that touches odds must be expressed as:
  * costs, refunds, or UI intel, not “better rolls”.
* Any mastery that touches HV must be:
  * explicit in UI, and
  * capped per item (no stacking spam).
* Keep stacking readable:
  * show “from mastery” lines in tooltips wherever values change.

### Telemetry (so tuning is real)

Track:

* Unlock rates by mastery and by player age.
* Scrap/hour delta and Fine Dust/hour delta for Efficiency Engine.
* Tether usage and dust refund rate for Field Conservator.
* Certification volume for Chain of Custody and Certified Restorer.
* Museum leaderboard penetration of Senior Researchers (identity impact).
