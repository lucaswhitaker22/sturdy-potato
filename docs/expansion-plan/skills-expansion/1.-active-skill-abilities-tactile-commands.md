# 1. Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

## Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

Skills in _Relic Vault_ are mostly passive.

Active abilities add “moment-to-moment” buttons without rewriting the RNG model.

They must stay consistent with [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

### 1.1 Design goals

* Give each core skill one high-signal “press moment”.
* Reward attention without creating mandatory APM.
* Create new, diegetic Scrap sinks (not taxes).
* Keep all odds readable and clamped where applicable.

Non-goals:

* Do not change base extraction outcomes (80/15/5).
* Do not change Lab Stability tables or stage rarity tables.
* Do not add a new currency.
* Do not add hidden multipliers.

### 1.2 Ability framework (shared rules)

#### Where abilities live

Abilities should appear only where they make sense:

* Field abilities live in \[01] THE FIELD.
* Lab reactions live in \[02] THE LAB.
* Bazaar abilities live in \[04] THE BAZAAR.
* Smelting abilities live on the Vault smelt surface (or Smelting panel) in \[03] THE VAULT.

#### Authority + anti-cheese rules

* All ability activation is server-authoritative.
* The server owns:
  * costs, cooldowns, and buff timestamps
  * any RNG used by the ability
* Clients only send intent: “activate ability”.

#### Stacking and clamping (keep math sane)

If an ability modifies Crate chance, it must be **flat/additive** and follow the canonical clamp:

* `p_crate_final = min(p_crate_base + bonuses_flat, 95%)`

This must stack cleanly with:

* [Seismic Surge](../micro-loop-expansion/1.-the-seismic-surge-active-extraction.md)
* [Vault Heatmaps](../micro-loop-expansion/6.-vault-heatmaps-zone-strategy.md)
* world events in ["The Great Static" Events](../macro-loop-expansion/5.-the-great-static-events-incl.-static-pulses.md)

### 1.3 Ability unlock gates (recommended)

Keep active abilities as “mid-to-late game toys”.

Recommended unlock:

* Each skill’s active ability unlocks at skill level `60`.

This mirrors the existing “advanced skilling starts at 60+” pattern.

### 1.4 Excavation active — “Focused Survey”

Focused Survey is a short, paid power window for active digging.

It increases Crate chance temporarily.

It does not touch Anomaly odds.

#### Where it lives (UI)

Location: \[01] THE FIELD.

Minimum UI:

* A button: **\[FOCUSED SURVEY]**
* A timer while active (`60s`)
* A live Scrap drain indicator

#### Activation rules

* Activation starts a `60s` buff window.
* Only affects **manual** \[EXTRACT] actions.
* Can’t be activated while the tray is full (same lockout as \[EXTRACT]).

#### Effect

While active:

* Apply a flat Crate chance bonus: `+10%` per manual extraction.
* Then clamp: `p_crate_final ≤ 95%` (canonical).

Hard rules:

* No changes to Scrap payout per action.
* No changes to the base 5% Anomaly roll.

#### Cost model (Scrap sink)

Focused Survey consumes Scrap over time.

Recommended tuning:

* Drain: `-5 Scrap/sec` for `60s` (total `300` Scrap)

If the player runs out of Scrap mid-buff:

* end the buff immediately (no negative Scrap).

#### Cooldown

Recommended:

* `5m` cooldown after buff ends.

#### Interactions

* With Seismic Surge:
  * Seismic Surge grading remains unchanged.
  * Both bonuses can apply to the same action (still clamped at 95%).
* With Vault Heatmaps:
  * Heatmap Crate bonus stacks additively (still clamped).

### 1.5 Restoration reaction — “Emergency Glue”

Emergency Glue is a rare “save” button.

It triggers only on a specific failure type.

It costs the rare material so it stays dramatic.

#### Where it lives (UI)

Location: \[02] THE LAB, inside the failure beat.

It appears only when eligible.

#### Trigger condition (strict)

Emergency Glue can be used only when:

* the Sift result is a **Standard Fail**, and
* the Lab is in the “System Error” glitch beat.

It must not trigger on:

* **Critical Fail** / overheat
* Stage 0 (cannot fail)

#### Player flow

1. Player clicks \[SIFT].
2. The Sift resolves as Standard Fail.
3. A 1-second reaction window opens.
4. The player can click **\[EMERGENCY GLUE]**.
5. The server resolves the save.

#### Effect (what “saving” means)

If Emergency Glue succeeds:

* Consume `1` Cursed Fragment.
* The crate is **not destroyed**.
* The run ends immediately as a forced **\[CLAIM]** at the **current stage**.
  * Example: you are at Stage 3 and tried to \[SIFT] to Stage 4.\ Glue converts the failure into a Stage 3 claim.

If Emergency Glue is not used (or misses):

* resolve the Standard Fail normally (Fine Dust payout).

Hard rule:

* Emergency Glue never converts a fail into a success.\ It converts a fail into a “safe exit”.

#### Stacking rule with Shatter Salvage

This must not stack with [Shatter Salvage](../micro-loop-expansion/5.-shatter-salvage-the-reaction-beat.md).

Implementation rule:

* One failure beat = one reaction choice.
* If both systems exist, show both buttons in the same 1s window.
* The first pressed button wins. The other is disabled.

#### Cooldown

This should be rare.

Recommended:

* `24h` cooldown (server time), or a very long cooldown like `6h` if daily feels too harsh.

### 1.6 Appraisal active — “Hype Train”

Hype Train is a paid visibility spike.

It does not change the economics of the listing.

#### Where it lives (UI)

Location: \[04] THE BAZAAR, on the player’s own active listings.

Minimum UI:

* Button: **\[HYPE TRAIN]**
* A “PROMOTED” badge on the listing during the window
* A timer (`5m`)

#### Effect

For `5m`, the listing gets:

* 1 global feed ping: `PROMOTED LISTING: <item>` (rate-limited)
* boosted placement in the Bazaar “featured” strip (cosmetic ordering)

Hard rules:

* No changes to bid rules.
* No changes to fees/tax.
* No forced minimum price.

#### Cost + anti-spam guardrails

Recommended tuning:

* Cost: `250` Scrap per activation.
* Cooldown: `30m`.
* Only one promoted listing per player at a time.

### 1.7 Smelting active — “Overclock Furnace”

Overclock Furnace is a short burst of throughput.

It trades off into higher Lab overheat risk for a while.

#### Where it lives (UI)

Location: \[03] THE VAULT on the smelting surface (or Smelting panel).

Minimum UI:

* Button: **\[OVERCLOCK FURNACE]**
* Active buff timer (`60s`)
* A visible “Overheated Systems” debuff timer (`10m`) shown in the Lab

#### Effect (buff window)

For `60s`:

* Smelting XP: `× 2.0`
* Scrap output from smelt actions: `× 2.0`

Clamping (recommended guardrail):

* `smelt_yield_multiplier_final = min(smelt_yield_multiplier_base * 2.0, 3.0)`

This prevents extreme stacking with Smelting 99 (“Pure Yield”).

#### Tradeoff (debuff window)

After the 60s buff ends, apply a `10m` debuff:

* Increase the chance of **Critical Fail** on Lab failures.
* Do not change the Success/Fail roll.

Recommended implementation:

* `p_critical_final = clamp(p_critical_current * 1.5, 0%, 90%)`

This should integrate with:

* [Active Stabilization (Lab Triage)](../micro-loop-expansion/2.-active-stabilization-lab-triage.md)

#### Cooldown

Recommended:

* `30m` cooldown after activation.

#### Integrity rules

* Overclock cannot apply to offline smelting (if that ever exists).
* Outputs must remain server-calculated (economy integrity).

### 1.8 UX requirements (feedback beats)

* Focused Survey:
  * servo whine + “scanner overlay” while active
  * clear countdown and visible Scrap drain tick
* Emergency Glue:
  * louder glitch beat + “STABILIZED” stamp on success
  * Cursed Fragment spend is shown as a hard, irreversible tick
* Hype Train:
  * feed ping is unmistakable but rate-limited
  * promoted badge is obvious
* Overclock Furnace:
  * furnace roar + orange UI tint during buff
  * Lab shows a warning banner during debuff: `SYSTEMS HOT: OVERHEAT RISK UP`

### 1.9 Telemetry (for tuning)

Track per ability:

* activation rate by skill level band
* Scrap spent per day
* net delta in crates/hour (Focused Survey)
* glue usage rate + “saved value” distribution (stage where it fired)
* hype usage and listing sale time delta
* overclock usage, total scrap generated, and resulting overheat rate
