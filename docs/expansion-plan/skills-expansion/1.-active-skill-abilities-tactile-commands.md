#### 1. Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

Currently, skills primarily provide passive bonuses. Introducing active abilities would allow players to strategically influence the Micro and Meso loops.

* Excavation — "Focused Survey": A toggleable ability that increases the Crate Drop Rate by +10% for 60 seconds but consumes Scrap per second.
* Restoration — "Emergency Glue": A high-cooldown reaction on **Standard Fail** only. During the Shatter beat, the player has 1 second to click this ability to “stabilize the wreck,” costing a Cursed Fragment.
  * It does not trigger on Critical Fail / overheat.
  * It should not stack with Shatter Salvage. One reaction window, one choice.
* Appraisal — "Hype Train": For a brief window, the player can "promote" their own Bazaar listing in the Global Feed, increasing its visibility for a small fee.
* Smelting — "Overclock Furnace": Temporarily doubles Smelting XP gain and Scrap output but increases the risk of a "Critical Fail" (cooldown) on all Lab actions for 10 minutes.
