# 1. Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

#### 1. Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

Currently, skills primarily provide passive bonuses. Introducing active abilities would allow players to strategically influence the Micro and Meso loops.

* Excavation — "Focused Survey": A toggleable ability that increases the Crate Drop Rate by +10% for 60 seconds but consumes Scrap per second.
* Restoration — "Emergency Glue": A high-cooldown reaction. If a Sift results in a Shatter, the player has 3 seconds to click this ability to "save" the crate at its current stage, costing a Cursed Fragment.
* Appraisal — "Hype Train": For a brief window, the player can "promote" their own Bazaar listing in the Global Feed, increasing its visibility for a small fee.
* Smelting — "Overclock Furnace": Temporarily doubles Smelting XP gain and Scrap output but increases the risk of a "Critical Fail" (cooldown) on all Lab actions for 10 minutes.
