# Expansion Plan

This section collects post-MVP expansions.

It’s a mix of loop deepening (micro), MMO systems (macro), and skill growth.

### Loop expansions

* [Micro Loop Expansion](micro-loop-expansion/)
* [Macro Loop Expansion](macro-loop-expansion.md)
* [Skills Expansion](skills-expansion.md)

### System proposals (grab bag)

These should stay consistent with the canon in:

* [2: The Mechanics](../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md)
* [4 - The MMO & Economy (Macro)](../game-overview/4-the-mmo-and-economy-macro.md)

#### 1. Advanced Assembly & Engineering (Blueprints)

Smelting is currently “break down junk”. This adds a creative craft/assembly layer.

* Component discovery: High-tier zones can drop "Fragmented Components" (Lens Array, Corroded Circuit).
* Assembly Bench: New deck where players combine components into custom tools or restored masterpieces.
* Blueprint market: Recipes become tradable (supports “recipe hunters”).

#### 2. Archive Expeditions (Contracts + narrative)

Formalize the Archive relationship as repeatable contracts.

* Research requisitions: Requests for specific items + conditions (e.g., “Three Preserved Soda Tabs”).
* Lore rewards: Vault Research Notes + temporary intel buffs.
  * Keep intel readable. Prefer “bands/ranges”, not exact mint math.
* Rank progression: Titles that unlock QoL in Bazaar/Museum.

See: [1. Archive Expeditions (Contractual Narrative Quests)](macro-loop-expansion/1.-archive-expeditions-contractual-narrative-quests.md)

#### 3. Influence-Gated Social Tiers (HI ladder)

Spend Historical Influence (HI) to unlock social perks.

* Archive Clerk (1,000 HI): Watch up to 5 Bazaar listings with push notifications.
* Senior Pathologist (5,000 HI): One free certification per 24h.
* High Curator (20,000 HI): “Master’s Gallery” display deck (no Bazaar lock).

See: [2. Influence-Gated Social Tiers (Macro Loop Expansion)](macro-loop-expansion/2.-influence-gated-social-tiers-macro-loop-expansion.md)

#### 4. “The Great Static” anomalies (world events)

Time-boxed mutators that stack on top of core odds.

* Magnetic Interference: Double Scrap from Auto-Diggers, and overload meter charges faster from Anomalies.
* Archive Audit: Higher Archive Tax, but boosted Museum scoring.
* Discovery Gold Rush: Short zone-based crate bonus after a Unique discovery.
