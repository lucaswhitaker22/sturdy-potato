# Expansion Plan

#### 1. Advanced Assembly & Engineering (The "Blueprints" Expansion)

Currently, Smelting is primarily used to break down junk for Scrap or recover rare Cursed Fragments. This expansion adds a creative layer to the "Refiner" path.

* Component Discovery: Instead of finding whole relics, certain high-tier zones could drop "Fragmented Components" (e.g., a "Lens Array" or "Corroded Circuit").
* The Assembly Bench: A new UI deck where players use Smelting and Appraisal skills to combine components into "Custom Tools" or "Restored Masterpieces".
* Blueprints: Building on the Phase 4 mention of "Unidentified Blueprints," players could sell specific assembly recipes in the Bazaar, creating a market for "Recipe Hunters".

#### 2. Archive Expeditions (Contractual Narrative Quests)

The Archive is described as a serious, bureaucratic institution that assigns value to items. A quest system could formalize this relationship.

* Research Requisitions: Periodic "Archive Contracts" could appear in the Archive deck, requesting specific items with certain conditions (e.g., "Three _Preserved_ Soda Tabs").
* Lore Rewards: Completing contracts could reward players with "Archive Clearance" (a temporary buff to hidden sub-stat visibility) or unique "Vault Research Notes" that reveal more about "The Great Static".
* Rank Progression: Players could earn specific titles like "Junior Clerk" or "Lead Pathologist" that modify their interaction with the Bazaar or Museum.

#### 5. Influence-Gated Social Tiers (Macro Loop Expansion)

Using Historical Influence (HI), players can climb a social hierarchy that provides functional perks.

* The Clerical Tiers:
  * Scavenger (Rank 0): Base access.
  * Archive Clerk (Rank 1 - 1,000 HI): Unlocks the ability to "Watch" up to 5 Bazaar listings with real-time push notifications.
  * Senior Pathologist (Rank 2 - 5,000 HI): Grants a dedicated "Certification" slot in the Bazaar, allowing the player to certify one item for free every 24 hours.
  * High Curator (Rank 3 - 20,000 HI): Unlocks the "Master's Gallery"—a private sub-deck where players can display their 10 highest-HV items for public viewing without locking them from the Bazaar.

#### 6. "The Great Static" Anomalies (World Event Expansion)

Fleshing out the 5% Anomaly chance and World Events, these create short-term "Mutators" for all players.

* Magnetic Interference: A global event where Auto-Diggers generate double Scrap, but Lab stability for electronic items (Rare tier) is reduced by 10%.
* Archive Audit: A 24-hour window where the Archive Tax is temporarily increased to 10%, but all Museum scores are doubled.
* Discovery Gold Rush: Triggered when a Unique item is found. For the next 60 minutes, the Crate Drop Rate is increased by +5% for all players currently in the same Zone.
