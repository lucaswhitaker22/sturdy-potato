# Macro Loop Expansion

These expansions deepen the macro loop: economy, social status, long-term sinks.

They should integrate with:

* Historical Influence (HI)
* Appraisal as “intel + efficiency”
* Digital scarcity (mint + condition)

They should **not** contradict the canonical odds in [2: The Mechanics](../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

#### 1. The "Counter-Bazaar" (Black Market Trading)

While the standard Bazaar is a clinical "Oasis" environment, the Counter-Bazaar is a high-risk, "Wasteland"-flavored marketplace for restricted trading.

* The Mechanic: Players can list items with a 0% Archive Tax (instead of the standard 5%), but there is a 2% "Confiscation Risk" per 24 hours the item remains listed.
* Integration: High levels of Appraisal reduce the Confiscation Risk, while reaching Master Trader (Level 99) allows players to see "Under-the-Table" listings that are hidden from lower-level scavengers.
* Macro Impact: This creates a secondary economy where players weigh the "Archive Tax" against the risk of losing a rare artifact.

#### 2. Syndicate Excavations (Cooperative Social Goals)

This expands the "Archaeology Teams" concept into a formal cooperative macro-loop.

* The Mechanic: Players can pool Historical Influence (HI) to fund a "Syndicate Permit". This unlocks a temporary (48-hour) high-tier zone for all members of the team.
* Integration: These permits require a minimum Total Level from the team leader and a collective HI deposit from all participants.
* Macro Impact: It transforms HI from a solo-progression currency into a community-leveraging tool, encouraging social coordination for access to the Sovereign Vault or Sunken Data Center.

#### 3. Artifact Leasing (The Rental Economy)

Because Set Completion grants permanent buffs like "Caffeine Rush," players often need one specific item to finalize a collection.

* The Mechanic: Owners can "Lease" a high-value relic to another player for a set Scrap fee. The item is temporarily moved to the borrower's Vault but cannot be sold, smelted, or donated to the Museum.
* Integration: The borrower gains the Set Multiplier or Buff for the duration of the lease, while the owner earns passive Scrap.
* Macro Impact: This provides a use-case for duplicate Low-Mint or Prismatic items that the owner doesn't want to sell permanently.

#### 4. Museum "Endowments" (Permanent Prestige)

The Museum currently operates on a weekly rotation. Endowments introduce a permanent "Hall of Fame" for the world's most significant finds.

* The Mechanic: Players can choose to "Endow" (permanently burn) a Mythic or Unique item into the Archive's permanent collection.
* Integration: This grants a permanent account-wide +1% Museum Score multiplier and a unique "Patron" title in the Global Feed.
* Macro Impact: It acts as a massive "Item Sink" for high-tier relics, preserving digital scarcity and ensuring that even the most prestigious items eventually leave the active trade economy.

#### 5. Macro-Economic "Static" Pulses (Dynamic Events)

This builds on the World Events logic by introducing financial volatility.

* The Mechanic: The Archive broadcasts a "Currency Devaluation" or "Industrial Boom" event.
* The Impact:
  * Industrial Boom: Smelting yield is doubled, but Archive Tax in the Bazaar increases to 10%.
  * Resource Drought: Crate drop rates are halved globally, but Historical Value (HV) for all Museum submissions is tripled.
* Integration: Players with Appraisal Level 90+ receive a 60-minute advanced warning in their private feed before a "Static Pulse" begins.

#### 6. The "Lore Keeper" Requisitions (Narrative Contracts)

Instead of competitive curation, these are specific, bureaucratic requests from the Archive for "Research".

* The Mechanic: The Archive requests three specific items in a specific condition (e.g., "Two _Preserved_ Lightbulbs and one _Mint_ AA Battery").
* Integration: Completing these contracts rewards unique Vault Research Notes that reveal hidden world-building or grant "Archive Clearance"—a temporary buff that shows the exact Mint Probability of any crate in the Lab.
* Macro Impact: This encourages players to hunt for specific Condition Modifiers rather than just focusing on rarity.

Alignment note:

* Keep “Archive Clearance” consistent with Pre-Sift Appraisal rules.
* It can upgrade **bands → more precise bands**, not reveal exact mint math or exact catalog IDs for free.
