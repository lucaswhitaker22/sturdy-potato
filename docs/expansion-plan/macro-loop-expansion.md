# Macro Loop Expansion

These expansions deepen the macro loop: economy, social status, long-term sinks.

They must integrate with:

* Historical Influence (HI)
* Appraisal as “intel + efficiency”
* Digital scarcity (mint + condition)

They must **not** contradict canonical odds in [2: The Mechanics](../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

### Expansion set (current proposal)

1. [The "Counter-Bazaar" (Black Market Trading)](macro-loop-expansion/1.-the-counter-bazaar-black-market-trading.md)\n 0% tax lane. Confiscation risk. Appraisal reduces risk.
2. [Influence-Gated Social Tiers (and Syndicate Excavations)](macro-loop-expansion/2.-influence-gated-social-tiers-and-syndicate-excavations.md)\n Spend HI for permanent status perks. Pool HI for temporary team zone access.
3. [Artifact Leasing (The Rental Economy)](macro-loop-expansion/3.-artifact-leasing-the-rental-economy.md)\n Temporary item loans for set completion and short-term buffs.
4. [Museum Endowments (Permanent Prestige)](macro-loop-expansion/4.-museum-endowments-permanent-prestige.md)\n Permanent item burn into a Hall of Fame. Small permanent prestige rewards.
5. ["The Great Static" Events (incl. Macro-Economic Static Pulses)](macro-loop-expansion/5.-the-great-static-events-incl.-static-pulses.md)\n World event “weather”. Volatility in tax, smelting, museum scoring.
6. [Lore Keeper Requisitions (Archive Expeditions)](macro-loop-expansion/6.-lore-keeper-requisitions-archive-expeditions.md)\n Bureaucratic contracts that create directed goals and item sinks.

### Alignment notes

* “Archive Clearance” must stay consistent with Pre-Sift Appraisal.\n It upgrades **bands → more precise bands**.\n It never reveals exact mint math or exact catalog IDs for free.
