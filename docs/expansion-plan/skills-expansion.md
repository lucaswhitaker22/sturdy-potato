# Skills Expansion

To further deepen the RPG experience in Relic Vault, the following expansions focus specifically on enhancing the four core skills and the underlying skilling systems.

Core skill specs:

* [Excavation](../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system/excavation.md)
* [Restoration](../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system/restoration.md)
* [Appraisal](../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system/appraisal.md)
* [Smelting](../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system/smelting.md)

#### 1. Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

Currently, skills primarily provide passive bonuses. Introducing active abilities would allow players to strategically influence the Micro and Meso loops.

* Excavation — "Focused Survey": A toggleable ability that increases the Crate Drop Rate by +10% for 60 seconds but consumes Scrap per second.
* Restoration — "Emergency Glue": A high-cooldown reaction on Standard Fail. During the Shatter beat, the player has 1 second to click this ability to “stabilize the wreck,” costing a Cursed Fragment.
* Appraisal — "Hype Train": For a brief window, the player can "promote" their own Bazaar listing in the Global Feed, increasing its visibility for a small fee.
* Smelting — "Overclock Furnace": Temporarily doubles Smelting XP gain and Scrap output but increases the risk of a "Critical Fail" (cooldown) on all Lab actions for 10 minutes.

#### 2. Skill Sub-Specializations (The Branching Path)

Upon reaching Level 60, players could choose a "Specialist Branch" for each skill, allowing for diverse high-level builds.

* Excavation Specializations:
  * Urban Scavenger: Biases item identity rolls toward "Household" and "Branded" (does not change rarity odds).
  * Tech Hunter: Biases item identity rolls toward "Complex Tech" and "Cultural Touchstones" (does not change rarity odds).
* Restoration Specializations:
  * Stable Hand: Flat Stability bonus for Stages 1–3 (visible, clamped).
  * Quantum Gambler: Flat Stability bonus for Stages 4–5 (visible, clamped).
* Appraisal Specializations:
  * Certified Valuator: Reduced certification fees + small explicit HV bonus on certification (once per item).
  * Economic Insider: Small early-warning edge for theme/zone shifts. Large event warnings remain gated by higher Appraisal.
* Smelting Specializations:
  * Fragment Alchemist: Buffs failure salvage (longer window / better Dust recovery). Any base fragment-chance changes require canon updates.
  * Scrap Tycoon: Increased Junk-tier Scrap yield (stacks cleanly with Smelting 99).

#### 3. Cross-Skill Masteries (Synergy Unlocks)

These unique perks unlock when two specific skills reach high levels, rewarding players for balanced progression.

* The Restorer-Merchant (Restoration 80 / Appraisal 80): **Certified Restorer** — If an item is restored by you and certified by you, it gains `+5%` HV (once per item).
* The Industrialist (Excavation 80 / Smelting 80): **Efficiency Engine** — Auto-Diggers generate `+5%` more Scrap. While online, they have a small chance to generate Fine Dust (tunable).
* The Archive Elite (All skills 90+): **Senior Researcher** — Unlock an Archive “Research Notes” panel, including an early preview of the next Museum Theme.

#### 4. Skill-Gated "Ancient Blueprints"

Building on the Excavation Mastery concept, high-level players could find and "Appraise" blueprints to unlock unique UI features.

* UI Blueprints: At high Appraisal levels, players find blueprints for custom Vault icons, unique progress bar animations, or specialized "Sift" sound effects.
* Tool Blueprints: Excavators (Level 99) can find blueprints for "Prototype Tools" that must be crafted using Smelting and high volumes of Fine Dust.

#### 5. Prestige: The "Archive Rebirth"

A long-term "Endgame" loop for players who have reached the Level 99 cap in all skills.

* Rebirth Mechanic: Players can "Reset" a skill to Level 1 in exchange for a permanent Archive Ribbon on their profile.
* Permanent Perks: Each Ribbon provides a small, global multiplier (e.g., +1% total XP gain, -0.5% Archive Tax, or +2% Battery Capacity for offline gains).
* The Founder’s Seal (Evolution): For every skill reset, the Founder’s Seal UI frame gains a new visual layer, such as a more intense "Obsidian Dust" pulse or a shifting prismatic color.
