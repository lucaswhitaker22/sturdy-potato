# Skills Expansion

To further deepen the RPG experience in Relic Vault, the following expansions focus specifically on enhancing the four core skills (Excavation, Restoration, Appraisal, and Smelting) and the underlying skilling systems.

#### 1. Active Skill Abilities (Tactile Commands)

Currently, skills primarily provide passive bonuses. Introducing active abilities would allow players to strategically influence the Micro and Meso loops.

* Excavation — "Focused Survey": A toggleable ability that increases the Crate Drop Rate by +10% for 60 seconds but consumes Scrap per second.
* Restoration — "Emergency Glue": A high-cooldown reaction. If a Sift results in a Shatter, the player has 3 seconds to click this ability to "save" the crate at its current stage, costing a Cursed Fragment.
* Appraisal — "Hype Train": For a brief window, the player can "promote" their own Bazaar listing in the Global Feed, increasing its visibility for a small fee.
* Smelting — "Overclock Furnace": Temporarily doubles Smelting XP gain and Scrap output but increases the risk of a "Critical Fail" (cooldown) on all Lab actions for 10 minutes.

#### 2. Skill Sub-Specializations (The Branching Path)

Upon reaching Level 60, players could choose a "Specialist Branch" for each skill, allowing for diverse high-level builds.

* Excavation Specializations:
  * Urban Scavenger: Higher drop rates for "Household" and "Branded" items.
  * Tech Hunter: Higher drop rates for "Complex Tech" and "Cultural Touchstones".
* Restoration Specializations:
  * Stable Hand: Permanently increases Stability for Stages 0–3.
  * Quantum Gambler: Reduces the success penalty for Stage 4 and 5 Quantum Reveals.
* Appraisal Specializations:
  * Certified Valuator: Fees for certifying items for other players are reduced, and certifications grant a higher HV boost.
  * Economic Insider: Grants a 5-minute advanced warning in the Global Feed before a World Event or Museum Theme changes.
* Smelting Specializations:
  * Fragment Alchemist: Higher chance to recover Cursed Fragments from shatters.
  * Scrap Tycoon: Maximizes Scrap yield from Junk-tier items.

#### 3. Cross-Skill Masteries (Synergy Unlocks)

These unique perks unlock when two specific skills reach high levels, rewarding players for balanced progression.

* The Restorer-Merchant (Resto 80 / Appraisal 80): "Certified Restorer" — Successfully certifying an item you restored yourself provides an additional +5% Historical Value (HV).
* The Industrialist (Excav 80 / Smelt 80): "Efficiency Engine" — Auto-Diggers generate 5% more Scrap and have a 1% chance to find Fine Dust directly.
* The Archive Elite (All Skills 90+): "Senior Researcher" — Access to a private Archive chat channel and early access to the next week's Museum Theme.

#### 4. Skill-Gated "Ancient Blueprints"

Building on the Excavation Mastery concept, high-level players could find and "Appraise" blueprints to unlock unique UI features.

* UI Blueprints: At high Appraisal levels, players find blueprints for custom Vault icons, unique progress bar animations, or specialized "Sift" sound effects.
* Tool Blueprints: Excavators (Level 99) can find blueprints for "Prototype Tools" that must be crafted using Smelting and high volumes of Fine Dust.

#### 5. Prestige: The "Archive Rebirth"

A long-term "Endgame" loop for players who have reached the Level 99 cap in all skills.

* Rebirth Mechanic: Players can "Reset" a skill to Level 1 in exchange for a permanent Archive Ribbon on their profile.
* Permanent Perks: Each Ribbon provides a small, global multiplier (e.g., +1% total XP gain, -0.5% Archive Tax, or +2% Battery Capacity for offline gains).
* The Founder’s Seal (Evolution): For every skill reset, the Founder’s Seal UI frame gains a new visual layer, such as a more intense "Obsidian Dust" pulse or a shifting prismatic color.
