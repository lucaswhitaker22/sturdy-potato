#### 5. "Shatter Salvage" (The Reaction Beat)

To make failure more interactive, Shatter Salvage adds a high-speed reaction task to the destruction of a relic.

* The Mechanic: When a Sift fails and the "System Error" glitch occurs, a 1-second window opens for the player to click a "Salvage" icon.
* The Impact: Success recovers 1 Cursed Fragment (for Stage 3+ shatters) or doubles the Fine Dust payout.
* Progression Integration: This directly feeds the Smelting "Fragment Alchemist" specialization, which increases the chance to recover these rare materials from high-level failures.
