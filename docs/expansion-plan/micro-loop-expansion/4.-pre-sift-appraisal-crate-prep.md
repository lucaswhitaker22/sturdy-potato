# 4. "Pre-Sift Appraisal" (Crate Prep) [IMPLEMENTED]

## "Pre-Sift Appraisal" (Crate Prep)

Pre-Sift Appraisal turns “which crate do I gamble on?” into a decision.

It lets players spend Scrap to learn **limited** info about a crate.

It does not change the Lab’s underlying odds in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

It leans on the existing **Appraisal** skill.

Full spec: [Appraisal](../../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system/appraisal.md).

### 4.1 Design goals

* Add a “meso-to-micro” bridge using a secondary skill.
* Make crate selection feel intentional, not random tray order.
* Create a clean Scrap sink that doesn’t feel like a tax.
* Keep Sift success odds and rarity odds unchanged.

Non-goals:

* Do not reveal the exact item catalog ID at low/mid levels.
* Do not guarantee Mint outcomes or “force good crates”.
* Do not create a mandatory step before every Lab action.
* Do not add Appraisal XP here.
* Keep skill canon intact.

### 4.2 Where it lives (UI + state)

Pre-Sift Appraisal lives in \[02] THE LAB on the **tray crate cards**.

It is only available while a crate is still “unopened”.

Required UI:

* A per-crate button: **\[APPRAISE]**.
* A small “Appraised” badge once complete.
* An “Intel panel” on the crate showing the reveals.
* A cost label: `Scrap cost` + `success chance`.

Authority rules:

* Appraisal results are server-owned and tied to `crate_id`.
* A crate can be appraised at most once.
* Reordering the tray must not change appraisal outcomes.

### 4.3 Player flow (single crate)

1. Player sees a crate in the tray (pre-Stage 0).
2. Player clicks **\[APPRAISE]**.
3. Server charges Scrap, then resolves the appraisal.
4. On success, the crate displays 1–3 pieces of intel.
5. Player chooses:
   * \[CLAIM] early (safe), or
   * \[SIFT] forward (risk), or
   * ignore the crate for later.

If the player never appraises, the Lab runs exactly as it does today.

### 4.4 Core mechanic (what an appraisal reveals)

Think of this as “signal”, not “truth”.

Appraisal reveals **ranges** and **probabilities** about the crate’s eventual relic.

It never changes the rolled outcomes.

#### Reveal A — Condition range (primary)

On success, show a condition range.

Use canon terms from [3 - The Loot & Collection Schema](../../game-overview/3-the-loot-and-collection-schema.md).

Example outputs:

* `Condition: Weathered → Preserved`
* `Condition: Preserved+ likely`
* `Condition: Wasteland Wrecked risk`

Rule:

* This is a **range label**, not an exact value.

#### Reveal B — Mint probability band (secondary)

On success, show a mint probability band.

Use bands, not raw percentages:

* `Mint odds: Low`
* `Mint odds: Medium`
* `Mint odds: High`

Hard rule:

* Never show “#001 chance” or any low-mint exact math here.

#### Reveal C — One hidden sub-stat (gated)

At Appraisal level `60+`, add one extra reveal:

* Reveal exactly **one** hidden sub-stat key.
* It must exist on a successful claim.
* Do not reveal its rolled magnitude.

Example:

* `Hidden stat: Set Affinity (Electronics)`
* `Hidden stat: Museum Score Bonus`

This is an EV hint.

It helps answer “is Stage 5 worth it?”.

### 4.5 Costs, success chance, and scaling

#### Cost (Scrap sink)

Appraisal costs Scrap.

Recommended baseline:

* `cost = 250 + (crate_stage_cap * 150)`

Where `crate_stage_cap` is the highest stage the crate has reached.

For Pre-Sift only, `crate_stage_cap = 0`, so the default is `250` Scrap.

This keeps it affordable.

It stays meaningful early-game.

#### Success chance (Appraisal skill matters)

Define:

* `p_success = clamp(30% + (Appraisal_Level * 0.7%), 30%, 90%)`

Rules:

* On failure, Scrap is still spent.
* A failed appraisal gives **no intel**.
* No “partial success” states.

This makes Appraisal feel valuable without becoming deterministic.

### 4.6 Interaction with Appraisal mastery (“The Oracle”)

At Appraisal level `99`, mastery grants **The Oracle**.

It lets you see item Condition before opening a crate.

Pre-Sift Appraisal should not compete with that.

Rules at level 99:

* Condition is shown automatically on the crate card.
* \[APPRAISE] is hidden (or relabeled to an optional “Full Scan”).
* Mint band and hidden-stat preview can stay gated.
* Keep it behind an explicit action and Scrap fee.

That keeps mastery premium.

It avoids turning every crate into free perfect info.

### 4.7 UX requirements (feedback beats)

Minimum feedback:

* \[APPRAISE] click triggers a short “scanner sweep”.
* On success:
  * Show `APPRAISAL SUCCESS` in the crate card.
  * Intel items animate in one by one.
* On failure:
  * Show `APPRAISAL FAILED` with a dry Archive-flavored line.
  * Example: “Signal corrupted by surface static.”

### 4.8 Edge cases + integrity constraints

* If the tray is full, appraisal still works.
* If a crate is already opened (Stage 0 resolved):
  * Disable appraisal to prevent confusion.
* If a crate is moved to another UI surface:
  * The appraisal badge and intel must persist.
* If the player disconnects mid-appraisal:
  * Resolve server-side.
  * On reconnect, show final result.

Anti-exploit rules:

* One appraisal per `crate_id`.
* No rerolls via cancel.
* Appraisal never reveals exact item ID before claim.

### 4.9 Telemetry (for tuning)

Track:

* Appraisal usage rate per session.
* Scrap spent on appraisal per day.
* Success rate by Appraisal level bands.
* Behavioral impact:
  * Does appraisal increase Stage 4–5 attempts?
  * Does it reduce “instant Raw Open and dump” behavior?
* Economic impact:
  * Change in Mythic/Unique volume entering the Bazaar.

Use this to tune:

* Scrap cost baseline.
* Success curve caps (`30%` to `90%`).
* Which intel types exist at low levels.
