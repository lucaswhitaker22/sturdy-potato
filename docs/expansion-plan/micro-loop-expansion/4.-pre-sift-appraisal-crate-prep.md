# 4. "Pre-Sift Appraisal" (Crate Prep)

####

This introduces a "Meso-to-Micro" bridge by allowing players to use their secondary skills before the gambling begins.

* The Mechanic: Before the first Sift (Stage 0), players can \[APPRAISE] a crate in the tray for a Scrap fee.
* The Impact: A successful appraisal reveals the "Mint Probability" or "Condition Range" (e.g., "Contains 80% Preserved or higher").
* Progression Integration: At Appraisal Level 60+, this also reveals one "Hidden Sub-stat" that will be active if the item is successfully claimed, helping the player decide if the risk of Sifting to Stage 5 is worth the potential Historical Value (HV).
