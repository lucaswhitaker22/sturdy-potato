# Micro Loop Expansion

The following expansions are designed to deepen the micro loop—Extract, Refine, and Reveal—by transforming passive timers into interactive systems that integrate with the existing skilling and economy frameworks.

#### 1. The "Seismic Surge" (Active Extraction)

To move beyond the static 3-second cooldown in the Field, the "Seismic Surge" introduces a rhythmic interaction during the \[EXTRACT] progress bar.

* The Mechanic: During the extraction window, a "Sweet Spot" appears on the progress bar. Clicking exactly when the indicator hits the spot grants a "Perfect Survey".
* The Impact: A Perfect Survey provides a +5% flat bonus to the Crate drop rate for that specific action and awards bonus Excavation XP.
* Progression Integration: As Excavation levels increase, the Sweet Spot grows larger, and at Level 99, "The Endless Vein" allows for a second Sweet Spot to appear, potentially triggering the 15% chance for double loot.

#### 2. "Active Stabilization" (Lab Triage)

Currently, Sifting is a binary "Success or Shatter" roll. Active Stabilization adds a reactive layer to the Lab tension.

* The Mechanic: While the "Stability Gauge" needle is swinging wildly during a Sift, players can spend small amounts of Fine Dust (recovered from previous shatters) to "Tether" the needle, temporarily slowing its movement.
* The Impact: This doesn't increase the success percentage directly but allows the player to "Force Stop" the needle in a safer zone, reducing the chance of a "Critical Fail" (overheat) outcome.
* Progression Integration: Higher Restoration levels reduce the Fine Dust cost per Tether, while the "Master Preserver" perk (Level 99) makes the needle movement 10% slower by default.

#### 3. "Anomaly Overload" (The Combo Meter)

This expansion leverages the 5% Anomaly outcome to create a short-term "Fever Mode" for active players.

* The Mechanic: Every time an Anomaly is triggered, it fills one segment of an "Overload Meter" in the Header. At three segments, the player can manually trigger "Overload."
* The Impact: For 60 seconds, extraction speed is increased by 50%, and the Lab "Raw Open" stage has a 5% chance to award a Common item instead of Junk.
* Progression Integration: This interacts with the "Magnetic Interference" world event logic, where during the event, anomalies fill the meter twice as fast.

#### 4. "Pre-Sift Appraisal" (Crate Prep)

This introduces a "Meso-to-Micro" bridge by allowing players to use their secondary skills before the gambling begins.

* The Mechanic: Before the first Sift (Stage 0), players can \[APPRAISE] a crate in the tray for a Scrap fee.
* The Impact: A successful appraisal reveals the "Mint Probability" or "Condition Range" (e.g., "Contains 80% Preserved or higher").
* Progression Integration: At Appraisal Level 60+, this also reveals one "Hidden Sub-stat" that will be active if the item is successfully claimed, helping the player decide if the risk of Sifting to Stage 5 is worth the potential Historical Value (HV).

#### 5. "Shatter Salvage" (The Reaction Beat)

To make failure more interactive, Shatter Salvage adds a high-speed reaction task to the destruction of a relic.

* The Mechanic: When a Sift fails and the "System Error" glitch occurs, a 1-second window opens for the player to click a "Salvage" icon.
* The Impact: Success recovers 1 Cursed Fragment (for Stage 3+ shatters) or doubles the Fine Dust payout.
* Progression Integration: This directly feeds the Smelting "Fragment Alchemist" specialization, which increases the chance to recover these rare materials from high-level failures.

#### 6. "Vault Heatmaps" (Zone Strategy)

This expansion makes the choice of where to dig more interactive based on the Global Feed.

* The Mechanic: The Field UI displays a "Static Intensity" heatmap for each unlocked Zone (e.g., The Sunken Mall vs. Rusty Suburbs).
* The Impact: Zones with higher "Static" have a +2% Crate drop rate but a -5% Sift Stability penalty in the Lab for items found there.
* Progression Integration: High-level Excavators can "Survey" a zone to briefly reduce its Static penalty for themselves, while Appraisal Level 99 ("The Oracle") provides the ability to see exactly which item catalog IDs are currently "trending" (dropping more frequently) in each zone.
