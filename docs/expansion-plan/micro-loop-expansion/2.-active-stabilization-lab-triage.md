# 2. "Active Stabilization" (Lab Triage)

## "Active Stabilization" (Lab Triage)

Active Stabilization adds a reactive “triage” layer to \[02] THE LAB.

It sits on top of the existing Sift model in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics/).

It uses **Fine Dust** as the input cost.

It targets **Critical Fail** avoidance.

### 2.1 Design goals

* Make the Stability Gauge feel interactive, not cosmetic.
* Add a meaningful use for Fine Dust.
* Reduce “feels-bad” overheat streaks for active players.
* Keep base Sift success odds unchanged.

Non-goals:

* Do not replace Restoration’s stability scaling.
* Do not turn every Sift into a rhythm mini-game.
* Do not create a “pay-to-win” path with Scrap.

### 2.2 What changes in the Lab

The Lab already has:

* Stage-based \[SIFT] with a Stability (success %) value.
* Failure states: Standard Fail vs Critical Fail (overheat cooldown).

Active Stabilization adds:

* A **Heat Zone** overlay on the Stability Gauge.
* A consumable action: **\[TETHER]** (spend Fine Dust).
* A second action: **\[FORCE STOP]** (lock the gauge).

The key rule:

* Triage only modifies **failure severity**.
* It does not change the **success roll**.

### 2.3 Player flow (one Sift)

1. Player clicks \[SIFT].
2. The Stability Gauge needle swings as usual.
3. Player may spend Fine Dust to \[TETHER].
4. Player may click \[FORCE STOP] at any time.
5. The Sift resolves:
   * Success or Fail uses the normal Stability odds.
   * If Fail, triage determines Standard vs Critical.

If the player does nothing, the Sift resolves normally.

### 2.4 Core mechanic

#### Step A — Success roll (unchanged)

Let `p_success` be the Sift success chance from:

* Stage base stability.
* Restoration flat bonuses.
* Other modifiers (sets, events, etc).

Roll once:

* Success: advance stage as usual.
* Fail: go to failure severity.

#### Step B — Failure severity roll (triage hook)

On failure, roll for:

* **Standard Fail** (Fine Dust payout).
* **Critical Fail** (0 payout + overheat cooldown).

Active Stabilization modifies this roll via a “heat factor”.

### 2.5 Gauge zones and “heat factor”

Add a zone overlay to the swinging needle:

* **Safe Zone**: normal operation.
* **Danger Zone**: overheated range.

When the player hits \[FORCE STOP], record `needle_pos` (0–100).

Compute:

* `heat_factor = 0` in Safe Zone.
* `heat_factor = 1` in Danger Zone.

If the player never Force Stops:

* Sample `needle_pos` at the server-side resolution moment.

This keeps the “needle fantasy” intact.

It also prevents client timing exploits.

### 2.6 Tethering (Fine Dust spend)

\[TETHER] is the player’s triage tool.

It does two things:

1. Slows needle movement for a short window.
2. Grants a temporary “cooling buffer”.

Rules:

* Each tether has a duration (e.g. `1.25s`).
* Tethers can stack up to `N` times per Sift (cap it).
* Each tether costs Fine Dust.

Recommended caps:

* Stage 1–2: max `1` tether.
* Stage 3–5: max `2` tethers.

### 2.7 Outcome math (suggested tuning)

Define a base critical chance on fail:

* Stage 1: `5%`
* Stage 2: `7%`
* Stage 3: `10%`
* Stage 4: `15%`
* Stage 5: `20%`

Then apply triage:

* If `heat_factor = 0`: critical chance multiplier `0.35x`
* If `heat_factor = 1`: critical chance multiplier `1.00x`

Apply tether “cooling buffer”:

* Each tether reduces critical chance by an additional `-20%` (multiplicative).
* Example: two tethers => `0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64x`

Final:

* `p_critical_final = clamp(p_critical_base * zone_mult * tether_mult, 0%, 90%)`

This preserves tension at high stages.

It also makes “playing well” feel tangible.

### 2.8 Costs and progression (Restoration)

Fine Dust is mainly earned from Standard Fails.

That makes triage self-funding over time.

#### Fine Dust cost per tether

Recommended baseline:

* Stage 1: `2` Fine Dust
* Stage 2: `3`
* Stage 3: `5`
* Stage 4: `8`
* Stage 5: `12`

Restoration discount:

* `cost_final = ceil(cost_base * (1 - (Restoration_Level * 0.004)))`
* Cap discount at `40%` total.

This keeps dust meaningful at endgame.

#### Level 99 synergy (“Master Preserver”)

[Master Preserver](../../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system/) already grants `+10%` base stability.

If Active Stabilization exists, add:

* Needle movement is `10%` slower by default.

This is a feel-good mastery perk.

It does not change the success odds directly.

### 2.9 UX requirements (feedback beats)

You want triage to feel like a surgical intervention.

Minimum feedback:

* Zone overlay on the gauge (Safe vs Danger).
* \[TETHER] press:
  * Brief “field clamp” animation on the needle.
  * A visible Fine Dust spend tick.
* \[FORCE STOP] press:
  * Needle locks with a hard snap sound.
  * Zone label flashes: “SAFE” or “DANGER”.
* On failure:
  * Standard Fail shows Fine Dust payout clearly.
  * Critical Fail uses a heavier glitch + “OVERHEAT” lockout.

### 2.10 Accessibility and anti-frustration

* Make \[TETHER] and \[FORCE STOP] work on keyboard.
* Add “Reduced Motion”.
  * Lower needle swing amplitude.
  * Keep zones readable.
* Never hide core odds.
  * Stability (success %) stays visible.
  * Critical risk stays implied via zones, not a new opaque stat.

### 2.11 Edge cases

* Stage 0 is 100% success.
  * Disable triage to avoid confusion.
* If Fine Dust is insufficient:
  * \[TETHER] is disabled.
  * Show required dust in the button label.
* If the Sift resolves while a tether is active:
  * Consume the tether cost anyway.
  * This prevents “free” buffering via spam.
* If the player leaves the Lab mid-Sift:
  * Resolve server-side.
  * Treat as “no Force Stop”.

### 2.12 Telemetry (for tuning)

Track per stage:

* Tether usage rate.
* Average dust spent per successful high-stage reveal.
* Critical Fail rate with and without triage.
* Dust “economy” health:
  * dust earned from failures vs dust spent on tethers.

Use this to adjust:

* Base critical chances.
* Zone multipliers.
* Dust costs and Restoration discount curve.
