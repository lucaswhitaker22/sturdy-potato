# 3. "Anomaly Overload" (The Combo Meter)

## 3. “Anomaly Overload” (The Combo Meter)

Anomaly Overload turns a rare outcome into a short, high-signal power window.

It rewards attention without changing the core anomaly odds.

Canon anchors:

* Field anomaly rules (immutable 5% outcome): [The Dig Site (Main Screen)](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics/the-dig-site-main-screen.md)
* Micro/meso master doc (baseline tuning): [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md)
* UI placement + sensory beats: [6 - UI/UX Wireframe & Flow](../../game-overview/6-ui-ux-wireframe-and-flow.md)

***

### Design goals

Overload must:

* Feel like a “fever mode” earned from rare moments.
* Be readable in one glance (meter + timer).
* Be manual-triggered (player agency).
* Stay server-authoritative and auditable.

Non-goals:

* Do not change the 5% anomaly roll.
* Do not create permanent power.
* Do not create a passive/offline “free mode”.

### The meter (how it charges)

#### Meter shape (canonical)

* `3` segments (0 → 3).
* Meter lives in the **global header**.
* Meter fills only from **Anomaly** outcomes.

#### Charge rule (baseline)

On an Anomaly outcome:

* Add `+1` segment.

Clamp at `3`.

#### World-event hook (Magnetic Interference)

During the “Magnetic Interference” world event:

* Anomalies charge the meter **twice as fast**.
* Implementation: add `+2` segments per anomaly (still clamped at `3`).

Spec: ["The Great Static" Events (incl. Static Pulses)](../macro-loop-expansion/5.-the-great-static-events-incl.-static-pulses.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
“Twice as fast” is about meter charge, not anomaly frequency.

Anomaly frequency remains `5%`.
{% endhint %}

### Triggering Overload (player agency)

When the meter reaches `3/3`:

* Show a clear CTA button: **\[TRIGGER OVERLOAD]**.
* Do not auto-trigger.

Trigger rules:

* Overload can only be triggered if meter is full.
* Trigger consumes the full meter (`3 → 0`).
* Trigger starts a buff timer.

Recommended guardrails:

* If Overload is active, you cannot charge the meter.
* If an Anomaly occurs while active, treat it as a normal anomaly (no extra charge).

***

### Overload effects (canonical baseline)

Duration:

* `60s`

#### Effect A — faster manual extraction

For the duration:

* Manual extraction speed `+50%`.

Implementation recommendation:

* Multiply manual Survey bar fill speed by `1.5×`.
* Keep passive ticks at `10s` (don’t retime ticks).

#### Effect B — Stage 0 “junk protection”

For the duration, on **Stage 0 (Raw Open)** only:

* If the Stage 0 result would have been **Junk**, roll an extra `5%` chance to upgrade it to **Common**.

Hard rules:

* This never affects Stages `1–5`.
* This never upgrades beyond Common.
* This roll is server-owned.

***

### UI/UX requirements

#### Header meter

* Show `0–3` segments.
* On full meter:
  * pulse the meter,
  * enable the trigger CTA.

#### Active state banner

While active:

* Show a timed banner: `OVERLOAD ACTIVE — 00:59`
* Show the two effect lines:
  * `+50% manual extraction speed`
  * `Stage 0: +5% Junk → Common`

#### End state

On end:

* Play a hard “power-down” beat.
* Remove the banner immediately.
* Meter returns to `0/3` and begins charging again.

***

### Authority and state (implementation notes)

All of this is server-owned.

Minimum per-player state:

* `overload_segments` (`0–3`)
* `overload_active_until` (nullable timestamp)

Event inputs:

* `anomaly_triggered` (validated Field outcome)
* `trigger_overload` (player intent)

Output modifiers:

* Manual extraction timing modifier (derived from `overload_active_until`)
* Stage 0 upgrade check (derived from `overload_active_until`)

Integrity:

* Never trust the client to:
  * increment segments,
  * start/stop timers,
  * apply Stage 0 upgrade rolls.

***

### Telemetry (for tuning)

Track:

* Anomalies per hour (should match 5% expectation).
* Overload triggers per day per player band.
* Average “time to full meter”.
* Overload usage conversion:
  * full meter occurrences vs triggers
* Stage 0 upgrade rate during overload (should be \~5% of Junk-at-Stage-0 outcomes).
