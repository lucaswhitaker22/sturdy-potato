# 3. "Anomaly Overload" (The Combo Meter)

## "Anomaly Overload" (The Combo Meter)

Anomaly Overload turns the 5% **Anomaly** outcome into momentum.

It creates a short “fever mode” window for active players.

It does **not** change the base RNG defined in [2: The Mechanics](../../game-overview/2-the-mechanics.md).

### 3.1 Design goals

* Make Anomalies feel like a build-up, not a dead-end roll.
* Reward “session play” with a burst of speed.
* Keep extraction outcome odds unchanged (Scrap / Crate / Anomaly).
* Keep Lab success odds unchanged (Stability % stays canonical).

Non-goals:

* Do not create a permanent multiplier.
* Do not create an “AFK hoard” mechanic that fills offline.
* Do not add a new currency.

### 3.2 Where it lives (UI + state)

Overload is a header-level system.

It is visible on every screen (Field, Lab, Vault).

Required UI:

* **Overload Meter** with `0–3` segments.
* A disabled **\[OVERLOAD]** button while not ready.
* A “ready” state when the meter is full.
* A countdown timer while Overload is active.

Authority rules:

* Segment gain, readiness, and timers are server-owned.
* The client only sends “trigger overload” requests.

### 3.3 Charging the meter (when segments fill)

Anomaly Overload listens to the existing extraction roll.

When an extraction resolves as **Anomaly**:

* Add `+1` segment to the meter.
* Clamp at `3` segments.

Scope:

* Manual \[EXTRACT] can fill the meter.
* Auto-digger ticks can fill the meter **only while the player is online**.
* Offline gains never fill the meter.

Lockouts:

* While Overload is active, the meter does not gain segments.
* After Overload ends, apply a short charge lockout (`30s`).

Anti-hoard decay:

* When the meter becomes full, start a “ready expiry” timer (`20m`).
* If not triggered before expiry, reset to `0` segments.

### 3.4 Triggering Overload (player intent)

When the meter reaches `3/3`:

1. The header shows **OVERLOAD READY**.
2. The player can click **\[OVERLOAD]** at any time.
3. Overload begins immediately and lasts `60s`.

Overload is never auto-triggered.

This keeps it “skillful timing,” not “free background value.”

### 3.5 Effects (what Overload actually does)

#### A) Extraction speed buff (time only)

For `60s`, set:

* `extract_speed_multiplier = 1.5`

This speeds up:

* Manual extraction action time + cooldown.
* Passive extraction progress while online (visual bar + server tick pacing).

Hard rules:

* It does not change the extraction loot table odds.
* It does not change Scrap amounts per action.
* It does not change Crate quality rules.

Interaction with Seismic Surge:

* If [Seismic Surge](1.-the-seismic-surge-active-extraction.md) exists, its Sweet Spot grading stays normalized.
* Overload makes the window shorter in real time, not “harder” in rules.

#### B) Lab “Raw Open” salvage hook (Stage 0 only)

While Overload is active, add a tiny “anti-junk” override to Stage 0.

On **Raw Open** resolution only:

* If the outcome would be `Junk`, roll `5%` to upgrade it to `Common`.

Hard rules:

* No impact on Stage 1–5 odds.
* No impact on Stability or shatter risk.
* No impact on Mint / Condition / HV logic.

This makes Overload feel like “static coherence,” not “paying off the gamble.”

### 3.6 Progression + system integration

#### Excavation synergy (natural, not special-cased)

Overload generates more extraction _attempts_ per minute.

That naturally synergizes with:

* higher tool speeds, and
* [Excavation](../../game-overview/5-rpg-skilling-system.md) mastery (“The Endless Vein”) because more attempts means more double-loot rolls.

No extra Excavation bonuses are required.

#### World Events: Magnetic Interference

If the world event **Magnetic Interference** is active (see [Expansion Plan](../)):

* Anomalies charge the meter **twice as fast**.
  * Each Anomaly adds `+2` segments (clamped at `3`).

This makes the event feel like “static storms” without changing the base 5% Anomaly roll.

#### Stacking rules (guardrails)

If global event modifiers also affect extraction speed:

* `extract_speed_final = clamp(event_mult * overload_mult, 1.0, 2.5)`

This keeps “speed metas” readable.

### 3.7 UX requirements (feedback beats)

Overload should feel like a system-wide power spike.

Minimum feedback:

* On Anomaly gain:
  * Segment fills with a sharp “static snap.”
  * Header briefly flashes: `+1 OVERLOAD`.
* On ready:
  * Meter pulses once per second.
  * \[OVERLOAD] button becomes primary.
* On activation:
  * Screen-edge vignette or scanline intensity bump.
  * A loud “breaker flip” sound.
  * Timer appears in header.
* On expiry:
  * A clean “power-down” beat.
  * Meter resets to empty.

### 3.8 Accessibility and anti-frustration

* Provide “Reduced Motion” for meter pulses and screen effects.
* Support keyboard activation for \[OVERLOAD].
* Never hide odds.
  * Overload is a timer buff, not a secret stat system.

### 3.9 Edge cases + integrity constraints

* If the tray is full, Overload can still run.
  * It just won’t create more Crates until the tray frees up.
* If the player disconnects mid-Overload:
  * The end timestamp is server-owned.
  * On reconnect, resume with remaining time (or end it if expired).
* If an Anomaly triggers while the meter is full:
  * Ignore the segment gain (no overflow banking).
* If an Anomaly triggers during Overload:
  * Do not charge the meter (prevents “infinite loops”).

### 3.10 Telemetry (for tuning)

Track:

* Time-to-fill distribution (in actions and minutes).
* Trigger rate (how often players actually press \[OVERLOAD]).
* Overload uptime per session.
* Crates/hour delta during Overload windows.
* Stage 0 salvage upgrades triggered per 1,000 Raw Opens.

Use this to tune:

* `60s` duration.
* `20m` expiry window.
* `1.5x` speed multiplier.
* `5%` Stage 0 salvage upgrade rate.
