# 3. "Anomaly Overload" (The Combo Meter)

This expansion leverages the 5% Anomaly outcome to create a short-term "Fever Mode" for active players.

* The Mechanic: Every time an Anomaly is triggered, it fills one segment of an "Overload Meter" in the Header. At three segments, the player can manually trigger "Overload."
* The Impact: For 60 seconds, extraction speed is increased by 50%, and the Lab "Raw Open" stage has a 5% chance to award a Common item instead of Junk.
* Progression Integration: This interacts with the "Magnetic Interference" world event logic, where during the event, anomalies fill the meter twice as fast.
