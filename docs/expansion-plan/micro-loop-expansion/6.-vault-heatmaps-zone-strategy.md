# 6. "Vault Heatmaps" (Zone Strategy)

#### 6. "Vault Heatmaps" (Zone Strategy)

This expansion makes the choice of where to dig more interactive based on the Global Feed.

* The Mechanic: The Field UI displays a "Static Intensity" heatmap for each unlocked Zone (e.g., The Sunken Mall vs. Rusty Suburbs).
* The Impact: Zones with higher "Static" have a +2% Crate drop rate but a -5% Sift Stability penalty in the Lab for items found there.
* Progression Integration: High-level Excavators can "Survey" a zone to briefly reduce its Static penalty for themselves, while Appraisal Level 99 ("The Oracle") provides the ability to see exactly which item catalog IDs are currently "trending" (dropping more frequently) in each zone.
